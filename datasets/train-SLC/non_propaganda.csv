US bloggers banned from entering UK
"Two prominent US bloggers have been banned from entering the UK, the Home Office has said."
"They were due to speak at an English Defence League march in Woolwich, where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed."
"A government spokesman said individuals whose presence ""is not conducive to the public good"" could be excluded by the home secretary."
'Right decision'
"They were due to attend a march planned by the far-right EDL to mark Armed Forces Day on 29 June, ending in Woolwich, south east London, where soldier Drummer Rigby was murdered last month."
"Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who had called for the bloggers to be banned from the UK, said: ""I welcome the home secretary's ban on Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer from entering the country."
This is the right decision.
"EDL leader Tommy Robinson, meanwhile, criticised the decision and said Ms Geller and Mr Spencer were coming to the UK to lay flowers at the place where Drummer Rigby died."
"It just shows what sort of a two-tier system we have here."""
'Foster hatred'
Anti-fascism campaigners Hope Not Hate had campaigned for the pair to not be allowed into the UK.
"""These two are among some of the most extreme anti-Muslim activists in the world."
They've nothing to contribute to life in this country.
"""They're not here to contribute to good community relations."
They only wanted to come here and help the EDL stir up more trouble.
"Britain doesn't need more hate even just for a few days."""
"Mr Spencer put up a copy of what appears to be the exclusion decision from the Home Office on the Jihad Watch website, while Ms Geller posted a copy of her letter on her website, Atlas Shrugs."
"The letters, both dated Tuesday, claim that both activists have fallen within the scope of a list of unacceptable behaviours by making statements which may ""foster hatred"" and lead to ""inter-community violence"" in the UK."
"Both letters gave examples of anti-Muslim views stated by both and went on to say that should they be allowed to enter the UK the home secretary believes they would ""continue to espouse such views""."
Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate — here's the story behind her killing
"Garcia Zarate, a 45-year-old Mexican national who was homeless and living in the US illegally when he fired the shot that killed Steinle, was acquitted by a jury on murder and manslaughter charges."
"The jury convicted him of the lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in state prison."
"Steinle, 32, was fatally shot while she walked along Pier 14 of the San Francisco Bay with her father in July 2015."
The bullet that pierced her back had ricocheted off the concrete ground after it was fired by Garcia Zarate from a handgun belonging to a federal ranger that had been stolen four days earlier.
Garcia Zarate's defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident — they said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it.
"Gonzalez told the jury, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, that Garcia Zarate had never handled a firearm before, was frightened by the noise of the gunshot, then flung the weapon into the bay where it was later found by a diver."
"Prosecutors, however, alleged that Garcia Zarate brought the weapon to the pier deliberately to do harm, and intentionally aimed and shot Steinle after firmly pulling the trigger."
They said Garcia Zarate then threw the weapon into the bay and fled the scene.
"Beyond the shooting itself, perhaps the most controversial aspect of Garcia Zarate's case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations, and how San Francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot Steinle."
"At the time of Steinle's death, Garcia Zarate had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes and deported five times since the early 1990s."
"He faced a sixth deportation in 2015, and was in Justice Department (DOJ) custody that March after serving 46 months in prison for a felony re-entry into the US, but instead of transferring him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation, the department transferred him to the San Francisco County Jail for prosecution of a 1995 marijuana charge."
"San Francisco prosecutors, who had long ago deprioritized marijuana charges, dismissed the decades-old charge and released Garcia Zarate on April 15, 2015."
"As a result of the case, both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policies."
The DOJ announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ICE to take custody.
"San Francisco, meanwhile, has adjusted its policy to notify ICE if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies."
But ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Francisco's custody.
The agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courts.
"Though the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up, their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding."
"San Francisco's policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judge-signed warrants, and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates' Fourth Amendment rights."
"President Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of ""Illegal Immigration."""
"Trump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinle's death during his presidential campaign, using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against ""sanctuary cities."""
"Early on Friday, Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the US six times due to lax border security under the Obama administration."
Trump tweeted.
"In fact, Garcia Zarate had never been convicted of a violent crime before Steinle's shooting — his previous convictions were for nonviolent drug crimes and illegal entry."
"Lax border security, too, does not appear to be a factor since Garcia Zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country under the Obama administration."
"In contrast, Steinle's family has expressed nuanced views on immigration and ""sanctuary"" policies."
"They have both condemned Trump for ""sensationalizing"" Steinle's death to advance anti-immigration policies, and expressed frustration with San Francisco officials, who they believe went too far in refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities."
The president is doubling down on an increasingly risky candidate.
"To begin with, Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside, party-aligned groups, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society."
That included an unusually central role for the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo.
That wasn’t entirely a Trump mistake.
"The party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative; to reassure them, he publicly committed to their top goal."
"In some ways, that’s successful coalition-building, and what he’s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges."
"Still, it’s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives; it’s another to turn the whole process over to them."
We don’t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump’s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him.
1
"Either way, Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting."
The judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start.
"After all, he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat, eventually getting confirmed with only four Democratic votes after a long delay."
"Kavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative, a hard-liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations."
"Nominating him, rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background, was bound to stir up trouble."
"It was also true, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned, that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh’s record, especially his service during the George W. Bush administration, was going to delay confirmation even more."
"Senate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn’t be produced rapidly, which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points."

Sometimes it’s worth taking risks.
Presidents who shy away from anything that’s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities.
"It’s just very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer, but still very conservative, other option."
3
"When serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate."
"Losing a high-profile fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts."
But there’s an art to minimizing damage.
"Whether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly isn’t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing."
"If the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh, the public might have concluded that it wasn’t Trump’s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light."
"Meanwhile, Trump’s behavior has been as erratic as ever."
"He sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview."
"The White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn’t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday."
"A botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on any initiative."
"And, for that matter, they’ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there’s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal."
"Trump’s professional reputation is already terrible, but everything counts."
"Trump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed."
"I've argued that too much disclosure is required, and that Democrats (and any wavering Republicans) had more than enough information to make up their mind."
I still think that's true.
"In the event, that's not what's causing the trouble, but still it's an example of Trump taking needless risks."
Some have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor if any cases stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court.
Perhaps.
"And if Kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue, then he won't be in the majority on any future decision anyway."
"So, no, I don't think there's any good reason to think Kavanaugh would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected."
"The president on Monday afternoon ordered that the documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,” according to a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders."
"It is not immediately clear how and when the documents will be released, but by Monday evening, intelligence agencies said they had already begun working to prepare the documents."
"“When the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America’s national security interests,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News."
“The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”
ODNI spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was “working expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.”
"The documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant."
The 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format.
The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.
Comey was fired from the bureau in May 2017; McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March; Page left the bureau in May; and Strzok was fired last month.
"A source familiar with the timing of the declassification told Fox News they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr."
"The source added that the Justice Department is working on a ""compressed timeline"" and they expect the first release of records in days or sooner."
"Congressional Republicans are hoping the files reveal details about the start of the Russia investigation led by the FBI, which evolved into Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election."
"Democrats, weeks later, released their own version of the memo."
Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim
"But there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from Kim, even as Trump announced he would end the regular military exercises the US conducts with South Korea."
"Whether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome of Tuesday's summit won't be known for years, if not decades."
"""We both want to do something."
We both are going to do something.
"And we have developed a very special bond,"" Trump said at the conclusion of the landmark summit."
"People are going to be very happy."""
"In exchange, Trump agreed to ""provide security guarantees"" to North Korea."
"But there was no mentioning the previous US aim of ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization."""
And Kim's commitments did not appear to go beyond what he already pledged to do in April when he met South Korean President Moon Jae-in along their countries' border.
Trump insisted during a news conference the agreement went further than many people expected.
But he acknowledged the effort to rid North Korea of its nuclear arsenal was in its early stages.
"""We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done,"" he said."
"""I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past,"" Trump said during the summit."
"Later, during his news conference, Trump said Warmbier's death contributed to the summit taking place."
"""Without Otto, this would not have happened,"" Trump said."
Trump's threats to politely walk out of the meeting if his expectations were unmet did not materialize.
The remarks came amid an improbable series of events that few could have anticipated even three months ago.
The unlikely images of US and North Korean counterparts engaging in friendly dialogue lent the day an air of unreality.
"In a detailed menu, the White House said the men were served Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream for dessert."
"Immediately after the encounter, Dennis Rodman -- one of the only Americans to have met Kim -- was openly weeping while being interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo."
"""Many people in the world will think of this as a (inaudible) form of fantasy ... from a science fiction movie,"" his translator was overheard saying as the two leaders walked down a white-columned colonnade."
"""We learned a lot about each other and our countries,"" Trump said."
The day began with Trump patting Kim on the back and placing his hand on the North Korean's shoulder as they walked into their first meeting.
Later they were seen smiling and laughing over lunch.
"The meeting came only months after the two men traded nuclear taunts, ratcheting up tensions and leading to fears of war."
"By contrast, Trump appeared to back off a military footing on Tuesday, declaring the US will stop the ""war games,"" an apparent reference to joint military exercises with South Korea that North Korea has long rebuked as provocative."
"Trump also said he hopes to eventually withdraw US forces from South Korea, but said ""that's not part of the equation right now."""
"""But that's not part of the equation right now."
"I hope it will be eventually."""
"Tuesday's meeting, convened at a luxury hotel on the island of Sentosa, came just three months after Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for talks on the spot."
"It was an extraordinarily compressed timeline for the landmark summit, which at one point was called off entirely as communication broke down between Washington and Pyongyang."
"The talks were quickly revived, leading to the highly choreographed event that unfolded Tuesday."
"After the men shook hands, they repaired inside for one-on-one talks."
"In that first meeting they were joined only by translators, a break from standard practice of having at least one aide present for high-stakes huddles."
"Later in the day, advisers joined the talks for a larger bilateral session and a working lunch."
"At the same time, he'd admitted he didn't believe he required extensive preparation to take stock of Kim."
"As part of the advance work, Trump commissioned a highly produced video meant to convince Kim to relinquish his weapons and open his country to outside investment."
Trump showed Kim the movie on an iPad during their talks.
"He was spotted taking a moonlit stroll around the high-end Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, owned by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, the type of glitzy development few North Koreans could ever imagine coming to their country."
A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge
Gym is Trenton Tolliver’s favorite class.
He gets to play matching games about Bible stories and listen to classic tales.
Noah and the Ark is a favorite.
"Adam and Eve and the garden of Eden, of course."
"And the story about how their son Cain killed his brother, Abel."
"“That one was a little bit of a surprise,” Trenton said as he sat with his parents, Brett and Courtney Tolliver, one day this month watching his little sister’s soccer practice on a lush field in this small town in the mountains of southern West Virginia."
"This spring, Bible classes such as Trenton’s are on the minds of many here in Mercer County."
"For decades, the county’s public schools have offered a weekly Bible class during the school day — 30 minutes at the elementary level and 45 minutes in middle school."
"Bible classes on school time are a rarity in public education, but here they are a long-standing tradition."
"The program is not mandatory, but almost every child in the district attends."
"And there is widespread support for the classes: Parents and community members help raise nearly $500,000 a year to pay for the Bible in the Schools program."
Now Bible in the Schools is facing a stiff legal challenge.
Two county residents with school-age children argue in a lawsuit that the program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment and the West Virginia constitution.
"Filed in January and amended last month by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the suit charges that the Bible class “advances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.”"
"Supporters are adamant that the weekly class is an elective meant to explore the history and literature of the Bible, not to promote religious belief."
“My experience with it has been very positive.
"I’ve never known of anyone who has been pressured or felt ostracized,” said the Rev."
"David W. Dockery, senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Princeton."
Trenton’s parents also find it hard to see why there would be objections.
"“I think it’s a great program mainly because it’s the only chance for some of these kids to even see the Bible,” said Brett Tolliver, 27."
"“More importantly, I don’t know who it harms."
The kids aren’t forced to be there.”
"Courtney Tolliver, 26, a teacher in the district, agrees."
"“It’s not teaching religion, but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth,” she said."
“The kids love it and the ones who don’t participate aren’t made to feel left out.”
But the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program’s popularity shouldn’t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity.
The suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact.
"The suit quotes from one lesson: “If all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.” Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time."
It says: “So picture Adam being able to crawl up on the back of a dinosaur!
He and Eve could have their own personal water slide!
Wouldn’t that be so wild!”
The district declined a request to observe one of the classes.
"Elizabeth Deal, who describes herself as agnostic, is one of the plaintiffs in the case."
"Her daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield, but Deal kept her out of the Bible class."
"Even though the class was optional, Deal said there weren’t any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out."
Her daughter was told to sit in the computer lab for that half-hour and read a book.
Eventually Deal moved her daughter to a public school a few miles away in Virginia where there is no Bible class.
"She pays an out-of-state fee of several hundred dollars, but she no longer worries about her child being taunted."
"“When something is wrong,” she said, “you have to stand up against it.”"
"God is a big deal in Mercer County, home to about 125 churches that dominate the main streets of its biggest towns, Princeton (population 6,400) and Bluefield (10,400), and smaller burgs such as Athens (1,000), Bramwell (360) and Oakvale (120)."
"A lot of the good jobs in the county have left — 22 percent of its 61,000 residents live below the poverty level — but the churches have stayed."
You can find the Church of God here.
And the Church of Christ.
And the Church of Jesus.
"There are a couple of Catholic churches, a synagogue and a mosque, but the vast majority of houses of worship are Baptist, Methodist or Pentecostal."
"The radio in the region is filled with gospel stations, Bible talk shows and Christian rock."
Billboards tout the Ten Commandments or offer stern messages on abortion and eternal salvation.
The Rev.
Ray Hurt has been the lead pastor at the Church of God in Princeton for more than two decades.
"The church, one of the largest buildings in town, can hold up to 2,000 people for Sunday services and often does."
"For Hurt, Bible in the Schools, which has been in the public schools here in one form or another since 1939, is simply a way for students to further their knowledge."
"“There is a great deal of not just poetry and prose in the Bible, but from what I’ve read almost every piece of history that’s in the Bible has eventually been proven,” he said."
“We see the Bible not just as a book of faith but as a pretty accurate account of history that informs us about a lot of things that happened.”
"Hurt, whose son, the Rev."
"J.B. Hurt, is also a minister in the Church of God and a member of the county school board, says he would oppose the program if he thought it was being used to teach religion or if students were required to take the class."
But he also embraces the idea that the Bible offers irrefutable lessons in morality and teaches the difference between right and wrong.
"“If you read the Bible, you’re going to get a whole lot of good ideas that are going to stick with you and make you a better person,” he said."
“You don’t have to push religion with it.
It speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics and those things.”
"The idea that a weekly Bible class for 6,600 students in 16 public elementary schools and three middle schools is somehow simply an academic offering doesn’t sit well with Lynne White, 54, a former two-term school board member and mother of two sons who went through Mercer schools."
"“As a person of faith myself, I don’t see any problem with having an after-school Bible program,” White said."
White holds the school board and leadership responsible for spreading what she says is a false sense of what the Bible in the Schools program is and does.
"She argued that the classes are character education based on biblical values, that they were not electives because West Virginia doesn’t offer electives in elementary or middle school and that even though the classes are funded by private donations, that doesn’t mean they should be taught during the instructional day."
She also said it was untrue that children who didn’t take the class weren’t made to “feel different or ostracized.”
"When White posted the article on Facebook, she heard from some supporters, but many others questioned her faith."
“I will pray for you and all non-believers Lynne White.
God Bless!
!” one wrote.
Another wrote:
"If it were simply a popularity contest, Bible in the Schools would be allowed to continue as is."
Even the president of the local mosque in Princeton says it should stay.
"“It’s good to be God-fearing no matter how you approach it,” said Mohammad Iqbal, head of the Islamic Society of the Appalachian Region."
"“Whether it’s the Bible, whether it’s Koran, whether it’s Torah, whether it’s some other book."
"But it should be optional, not enforced."
"If the parents have no objection and the student has no objection, it is okay.”"
But the program’s fate will not be resolved by popular vote or on Facebook posts.
"Representing the Mercer school district is the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit law firm based in Texas that specializes in religious freedom cases."
"Hiram Sasser, a lawyer at the firm, said the district’s main objective is to allow the Bible course to remain as an elective while making sure it complies with the law."
The district filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday.
"“There are two things to look at,” Sasser said."
“The first is whether you can have a Bible course at all.
And the other is whether you can have the Bible course as it is presently constituted.
It’s fair to say that we’re very confident on the first issue.
And on the second issue .
.
.
But the plaintiffs aren’t looking for flexibility.
They want the Bible class out of the school day.
"The program “is unconstitutional at its core and cannot be saved via modifications,” said Patrick Elliott, a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation."
“There is no legally permissible way for Mercer County Schools to continue with any type of program like this.”
"The amended complaint, Elliott said, seeks to prevent the school system from “organizing, administering, or otherwise endorsing Bible classes for Mercer County Schools’ students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.”"
"Charles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum in Washington, doesn’t foresee the program surviving a court challenge in its current form."
"“This is a loser for the school district,” Haynes said."
“It’s difficult to satisfy the First Amendment in elementary school when it comes to the Bible.
Students at that age really aren’t prepared to tell the difference between what is history and what is religious conviction.”
Haynes argues that people of faith are doing their religion a disservice when they try to have it taught by a government entity.
"They would rightly object, he said, if they lived somewhere where they were the religious minority and supporters of another religion wanted a course on their faith taught in public schools."
Trenton Tolliver is oblivious to the Bible battle that swirls around him.
His first-grade school year ends next month.
Hanging in the balance of the court case is what he will learn in the Bible course in second grade.
Or if there will be a Bible course at all.
Paul Manafort Secretly Met With Julian Assange Shortly Before Joining Trump's Presidential Campaign: Report
A British newspaper alleges that Paul Manafort secretly met WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London within days or weeks of being brought aboard Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
Lawyers for Assange and Manafort denounced the report as false.
"If confirmed, the report Tuesday would suggest a direct connection between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, which released tens of thousands of emails stolen by Russian spies during the 2016 election."
"The campaign seized on the emails to undermine Trump’s rival, Hillary Clinton."
"The Guardian, which did not identify the sources for its reporting, said that Manafort met with Assange “around March 2016” — the same month that Russian hackers began their all-out effort to steal emails from the Clinton campaign."
"“I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,” Manafort said."
"“I have never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks, either directly or indirectly."
"Assange’s Ecuadorean lawyer, Carlos Poveda, said the Guardian report was false."
"The Guardian cited two unidentified sources as saying Manafort first met Assange at the embassy in 2013, a year after Assange took refuge there to avoid being extradited to Sweden over sex crime allegations."
The Guardian said Manafort returned there in 2015 and 2016 and said its sources had “tentatively dated” the final visit to March.
The newspaper added that Manafort’s visit was not entered into the embassy’s log book and cited a source as saying Manafort left after 40 minutes.
There was no detail on what might have been discussed.
"The Trump campaign announced Manafort’s hire on March 29, 2016, and he served as the convention manager tasked with lining up delegates for the Republican National Convention."
He was promoted to campaign chairman in May 2016.
Swedish PM does not rule out use of army to end gang violence
"Sweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday."
"Sweden’s murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope."
"In 2016, the latest year for which official statistics are available, 106 people were murdered in Sweden, a country of 10 million."
"But Swedish TV reported there were over 300 shootings, mostly in turf battles between gangs over drugs, protection rackets and prostitution."
Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year.
One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm.
"Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants."
"The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ($880 million) through 2020, toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails, among other measures."
But a report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows increasing numbers of Swedes worried about crime with confidence falling in the police and the judicial system.
"“People are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades they find on the street,” Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said in parliament on Wednesday."
Florida shooting: Gun control law moves step closer
The state's House of Representatives passed a bill raising the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and imposing a three-day waiting period on all gun sales.
"The bill, already passed by the Senate, now goes to the state governor."
"Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February."
"Expelled former student Nikolas Cruz, 19, has been charged in the attack."
"He was formally indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday on 34 counts, including 17 counts of premeditated first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder."
"He is suspected of using a legally bought AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to carry out the 10-minute attack, gunning down teachers and students."
What is in the new law?
"In addition to raising the age and bringing in the three-day waiting period, the legislation:"
"Introduces a voluntary armed ""guardian programme"" for schools, named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the Parkland shooting."
"It allows school personnel to be armed, subject to school district approval and specialist training"
Classroom teachers are excluded from carrying arms unless they have a security forces background
"Bans devices, such as bump stocks, that modify a semi-automatic weapon to fully automatic"
Raises mental health funding and increases the power to seize or ban guns under mental health concerns
"The legislation does not include a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons like the AR-15, despite it being a key demand of Parkland students and their parents."
Florida law already mandates a three-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun but a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle with no waiting period.
The Republican-controlled House debated the bill for about eight hours on Wednesday before voting 67-50 in favour.
Has the move been welcomed?
"He said: ""We know that when it comes to preventing future acts of school violence, today's vote is just the beginning of our journey."""
Florida now joins at least six other states in allowing school employees to carry firearms.
"Following the Parkland shooting, many surviving students had lobbied politicians for greater gun control."
Gun control activists will hope the Florida measures will be a turning point in their battle with the powerful National Rifle Association and others who defend firearms ownership under the Second Amendment of the US constitution.
"On the day the vote passed, a 17-year-old woman student was killed in a suspected accidental shooting at a high school in Alabama."
What happens now?
"Governor Rick Scott will need to sign the bill, known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, into law."
It will automatically become law within 15 days unless he vetoes it.
"Mr Scott has not yet said he will back it, telling reporters he would ""review the bill line by line"" and consult victims' families."
He has previously said he opposes US President Donald Trump's call to arm teachers.
He had also previously opposed increasing the purchase age from 18 to 21.
Wait!
Wait!
It’s all a MISTRANSLATION!
Yet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel.
"It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one’s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal."
"In other words, the conscience can “inform” a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking “for now,” given one’s particular “limits.” This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium."
"But it’s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr."
"Dawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary."
Dr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr.
Dawn Goldstein
Here we go again.
So what does the Latin say?
Here is the paragraph in the official Latin:
"Haec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar."
"Yes, and so what?"
"Well, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: “what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,” the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering."
"So, What the Pope Really Means® is: “what for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.” So, it’s an offering to God, not a response to God."
Big difference.
But just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an “offering” to God?
It would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one’s “limits” make obedience to the moral law difficult.
Fastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.
"What about the English locution “while yet not fully the objective ideal,” which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals?"
"Not so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend."
Give.
Me.
A.
Break.
"A pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: “(1) copy/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal."
"Likewise, the definition of the English word “exemplar” is simply: “an ideal model.”"
Here too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away.
For if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely “exemplary” rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men—including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery—then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue.
"Thus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least “for now” (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an “ex” who has “remarried” and is now mired in the “concrete complexity one’s limits.”"
"According to their proposed “alternate translation” into English, What the Pope Really Means® is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one’s “limits” is “the offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.” Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words."
It seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness.
"Indeed, their “proposed alternate translation” reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in “second marriages” to the “perfect objective model.” Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery?"
Are you perfect?
"Then again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law."
"And Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green."
No problem here!
has been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.
"But the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in “second marriages” do not have to live in continence, but rather—in “certain cases”—may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a “process of discernment.” As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them “there is no other interpretation.”"
"Moreover, the Maltese bishops' “guidelines” for implementing AL, published in L’Osservatore Romano—for which Bergoglio thanked them—declare thus:"
"If, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with “humility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God’s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it” (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351)."
"This Pope’s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis."
See the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.
Shaw maintains that AL can be “bent into some kind of orthodoxy.” Perhaps.
But it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope’s statements into conformity with the Faith.
"Moreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers—while others disagree—has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct."
"But Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction."
As Shaw observes of AL: “What we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.”
"But Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy—undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally—without the guilt of an explicit promulgation."
"In so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ)."
"Honorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine."
And yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy.
"A similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it."
"Meanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy."
"In a classic power move, he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke, the perceived leader of the opposition, by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura—the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect."
"And this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta, to which he was exiled after his removal."
"Will this sop buy Burke’s silence, staving off the feared public correction?"
We will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily.
Israel Takes On the Shia Crescent
"Meanwhile, Syria has become ground zero for Iran's execution of its regional ambitions, which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon."
"This plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian-backed militias secured in June, beginning on Iran’s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria’s Mediterranean coast."
"This road makes Iran’s job easier in supplying arms by land, as well as by air and sea, to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and to equip Iran’s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad."
"This helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border."
"“Everything depends now on the Americans’ willingness to stop this,” said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article."
"However, U.S.-led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran’s Shiite Crescent expansion."
"“Obama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly, by the time this administration took over,” said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy."
"Furthermore, Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad's forces."
And Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers.
"While Israel chose not to take sides in Syria's civil war with military intervention of its own, it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection."
"Just recently, on September 7th, Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf, which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles."
"Israel will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights, shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories."
"However, such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran’s larger ambitions."
"In light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria, Israeli leaders have concluded that they cannot wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy."
"“Their overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country,” wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy."
"As long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran’s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner, “Israel is determined to continue addressing it on its own.”"
"At least, Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran’s growing threat, not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond."
"As the U.S.-led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria, the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite, as Iran has essentially done in Iraq."
National Security Adviser H.R.
"In the meantime, Israel will have to deal with the fallout of Iran’s ambitions in Syria itself."
This report was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com
"The man, a former Marine who called himself Rick, says he was Paddock’s neighbor between December 2015 and June 2016 in Mesquite, Nevada."
"“He never even told me that he owned a gun,” continued the shooter’s neighbor, adding that Paddock did not express any religious or political opinions during their conversations."
"The caller mentioned how some people in the crowd were warned 45 minutes before the shooting that they were going to die, suggesting that this was evidence of a wider plot and not a “lone wolf” attack."
"As a firearms expert, he also questioned the lack of flashes coming from the hotel windows where the shooter was supposedly firing from."
Rick said he had already contacted the Clark County Sheriff’s Office to relay all the information he knew.
"If Paddock was planning such a sophisticated operation and hoping to evade detection, he would not be blabbing details about it to his neighbors."
"However, the neighbor’s claims are certain to attract more attention given that no specific motive has yet to be uncovered for the shooting."

Receipt Shows Paddock Had Another Guest in His Room Before Shooting
This report was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars
An image posted on Facebook by a man who claims he served Stephen Paddock room service shows that the gunman was with a guest during his time at the Mandalay Bay hotel four days before the massacre took place.
"The receipt shows an employee named Antonio served two guests an “IRA_MB,” which means “In Room Dining, Mandalay Bay.”"
The table number is “32135” – which equates to Paddock’s room number (135) on the 32nd floor.
"Paddock ordered a burger, a bagel with cream cheese, a potato soup, one bottle of water and two Pepsis, suggesting that there was another person eating with him in the room."
The receipt shows the number “2” next to the word “Guests”.
"The date on the receipt also says September 27, whereas authorities assert that Paddock checked in the day after on September 28."
Paddock’s guest could not have been his girlfriend Marilou Danley because she was in the Philippines at the time.
"The individual who posted the receipt appears to have deleted it from his Facebook page, although the page still shows that he works at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino."
"Another source told Laura Loomer that the gunman actually checked in on September 25, three days before authorities said he did."
Source who works at @MandalayBay said #StephenPaddock had the suite since Sep. 25th.
Why did police lie and say he checked in on Sep. 28th?
"pic.twitter.com/WivxGRqB6W — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) October 4, 2017"
Authorities must surely now be on the hunt for whoever Paddock dined with in order to ascertain whether this individual was involved in the plot and whether or not it was the same woman who reportedly told concert-goers they were “going to die” 45 minutes before the shooting took place.

Over the last few days the alternative media has spent countless hours conducting their own investigations into what actually happened during the mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and over 500 injured.
"The picture “proves FBI misled public about #StephenPaddock’s check in date,” Loomer Tweeted."

"Shockingly, another Tweet by Loomer also revealed that the license plate numbers given out by police after the horrific shooting DO NOT match the actual license plate of Paddock’s vehicle."
Law enforcement and @FBI misled the public about #Paddock‘s check in date and also provided public & media w/ wrong license plate number.

"That’s right, photographic evidence from inside the hotel parking garage has confirmed that the FBI, along with state and local police, specifically lied about key details of the shooting."
Keep in mind that at least four videos from the scene of the shooting have already been released that indicate there were multiple shooters.
"In fact, there are so many unanswered questions that the Drudge Report even linked to an article asking them directly."
"And if Paddock really did act alone and this evidence is some sort of mistake, there is surely video footage proving so."
Notice #StephenPaddock‘s van was last parked right next to a security camera inside “Garage East” @MandalayBay.
There is definitely footage.

It is also important to note that Paddock’s brother Eric has conducted a series of bizarre interviews that have led to even more questions about what actually happened in Las Vegas and what Paddock’s role was in the worst mass shooting in American history.
‘Suicide Note’ Seen in Vegas Shooter’s Hotel Room
"A mysterious piece of paper discovered last week, when photos from the Las Vegas gunman’s hotel room were leaked to the media, is now back in the news cycle."
The pictures were published by numerous news outlets and shared by millions of people on social media.
"At the time the photos were published by the Daily Mail, police had not mentioned if Paddock left behind a note in his hotel room."
Nevada Sheriff Joe Lombardo said police were investigating who leaked the crime scene photos.
"In one photo in particular, a white piece of paper or notepad on a side table next to a chair is visible, which caused some to speculate that it may have been a suicide note."

It appears the Las Vegas Shooter left a suicide note.
"pic.twitter.com/ATtPMR6cUN — STUMP 4 TRUMP (@Stump4TrumpPAC) October 3, 2017"
"On Thursday, investigators revealed that the note in the photo was not, in fact, a suicide note but neglected to provide further details about the purpose of the note."
"In their first in-depth interview, which will air on CBS Sunday evening, the officers who stormed Stephen Paddock’s hotel room revealed new details to 60 Minutes that finally explain what was written on the mysterious note."
"“I could see on it he had written the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for the crowd,” said Officer Dave Newton from the Las Vegas Police in a preview clip of Sunday’s report."
“So he had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there.”
Paddock’s note was clearly not a suicide letter.
"Rather, it detailed bullet trajectory and included calculations about where he needed to aim his weapons to maximize accuracy and optimize his kill rate."
Investigators have also been looking for a ‘mystery woman’ who was seen with Stephen Paddock in the days leading up to the Las Vegas shooting.
"According to ABC News, the ‘mystery woman’ everyone on the internet was talking about has been identified."
Police are still investigating whether or not Paddock acted alone.
As ABC reported Friday evening:
"“Meantime, investigators are still trying to figure out whether Paddock acted alone."
"Authorities believe he may have had an accomplice, based on the elaborate planning on Sunday night’s rampage."
"Though more details are being released each day, Paddock’s motives remain unclear."
The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event
"Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism."
The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history.
The fruits of the AJHS and JVP partnership have been a series of events attacking Israel.
Coming up in late October is “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?”
"The two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel."
"He has claimed that the ""Jewish community gradually consolidated its power, wealth, and influence in all sectors of society"" especially in ""crucial sectors like banking, finance, media” where ""their influence both as individuals and an organized community far exceeded their numbers"" and that their power strengthens “conspiracy theories about ‘Jewish control’ that are reminiscent of the infamous “’Protocols of the Elders of Zion.’”"
Robert Herbst and Jonathan Kuttab are both supporters of a one-state plan for eliminating Israel.
"The American Jewish Historical Society is co-sponsoring a JVP anti-Israel event by two opponents of Israel, one of whom has defended Hamas."
"An organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award, named after a passionate Zionist, at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel."
"The “Jewish Homeland” or “Jewish State” argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration didn’t endorse Israel, but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country."
That worked so well for the Christians and Jews of the Middle East.
The American Jewish Historical Society is not only co-sponsoring a one-state event by an anti-Israel hate group.
But it’s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History’s headquarters.
AJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History.
"And the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History."
"During the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a “JVP Academic Advisory Board Member.” But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP."
The Balfour event was not AJHS’ only partnership with JVP.
"In December, the AJHS will feature “Rubble Rubble”, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel."
Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council.
His goal is to “normalize Jewish anti-Zionism”.
AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission.
The venue is once again the Center for Jewish History.
Specifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH.
Leo Forchheimer’s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel.
What would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?
AJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives.
"But when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective."
“Balfour” and “Rubble Rubble” are to be part of AJHS’ “1917: How One Year Changed the World”.
"The exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration."
But the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist.
The exhibition closes with Fishback’s anti-Israel agenda.
And these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel.
JVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events.
The American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events.
It’s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups.
Instead it’s providing a forum for a BDS hate group.
And it’s no mystery why.
The AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists.
"Lila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council."
"Open Hillel seeks to ""open"" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views."
"Berman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS."
She signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel.
"Other AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich."
"When we look at what is going on in CJH’s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising."
Myers is a symptom of the problem.
As is AJHS’s partnership with JVP.
A great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to.
"Unlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century."
And yet it’s inescapable.
The radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding “moderate” opposing voices into Jewish organizations.
Instead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti-Israel hatred.
And it will not be satisfied with anything less.
"During the Myers controversy, defenders of his appointment, including some figures named here, claimed that it was an issue of apolitical scholarship."
The anti-Israel leftists at the AJHS are clearly not leaving their politics at home.
And support for them and for Myers cannot be distinguished from support for their views.
Not when JVP is at AJHS.
Sometimes the choices are murky.
Other times they are simple and easy.
"When the American Jewish Historical Society hosts and co-sponsors an event by a BDS hate group attacking the existence of Israel and featuring a speaker who had defended terrorism and anti-Semitism, the choice becomes easy."
"As the anti-Israel radicalism of the left grows, such choices will become even more obscenely simple."
But they will not be any less difficult.
Opposing the anti-Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends.
"The anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field."
Speaking out against hate is easiest when it’s weakest.
It’s hardest when it’s strongest.
"When we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out."
We don’t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it.
History tells us why so many people are afraid to do the right thing when it counts.
It also tells us how irrelevant history makes them.
"There are lessons here for the Center for Jewish History and the American Jewish Historical Society, for those on the inside who see the corruption of their organizations every day and for those on the outside who are worried about speaking up."
There are lessons here for all of us.
"If you can’t speak out against the American Jewish Historical Society’s partnership with a hate group linked to a literal blood libels and a speaker who defends Hamas, when will your voice be heard?"
Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist
"Pope Paul VI’s 1965 encyclical on the Eucharist, “Mysterium Fidei,” was the first place I saw anyone say that the body and blood, soul and complete divinity of Christ was actually present in the consecrated species."
"Having been raised in Remi de Roo’s Victoria in the 1970s, I had naturally never heard anything at all about the Eucharist."
The understanding that Catholics believed what they believe about it came as a bit of a shock.
(Read the full document here. )
"Published just three months before the close of Vatican II and just as Annibale Bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his never-ending stream of liturgical alterations, Mysterium Fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in Catholic history, perhaps the most important of modern times."
"Therefore, we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion, so that the Holy Church, under this saving sign of piety, may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all Christians to a unity of faith and of love, drawing them gently, thanks to the action of divine grace."
"But in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the Catholic religion, I knew nothing of any of that."
"The encyclical, the very first I ever read, was also a marker for me of a personal turning point."
It was the first time I had ever seen Catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and – most importantly – unapologetically stated.
"It came right out and said something so astounding, something so completely unlikely, that I had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities."
Like C.S.
"Lewis’s assessment of the claims by Christ of His own divinity, this pope was either mad, bad or telling the plain truth."
"Something that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year I read it, is that the pope’s very first quote was not of scripture, but the Council of Trent:"
"“At the Last Supper, on the night He was handed over, Our Lord instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood, to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He should come, and thus entrust to the Church, His beloved spouse, the memorial of His death and resurrection: a sacrament of devotion, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is received, the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory.”"
"In these words are highlighted both the sacrifice, which pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily, and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood, receiving both grace, the beginning of eternal life, and the medicine of immortality."
I remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement… “By doing what?
!”
What could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it weren’t true?
"By the time I read it, I had been through a long, slow transition from a childhood devoted to Our Lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders, to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan Catholic parochial school."
What led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point.
"It was the first time it occurred to me to investigate, like an anthropologist, what the Church herself said about her teachings."
"While mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the Catholic Church, I was pulled up short by a single thought: “I could be wrong.” At 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think I was rather shocked."
"But stopping a moment to consider, I realised that I had only ever heard about Catholic things from people who clearly hated the Church; her enemies, in short."
It hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses.
"In order to properly and thoroughly condemn the Church, with convincing due diligence, I had to read something about it that didn’t come from her enemies."
"The same day, I presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked, “Do you have any books about Catholicism?"
"Something official?” The librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals, documents and histories."
Saints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other.
"Having no clear idea what my own question meant, I just picked one at random."
"The description of the Holy Eucharist as the supreme Centre from which all our life as Catholics flow, and from which all other doctrines radiated, was something that was not going to come into my head for another eight years of reading."
"But even so, Mysterium Fidei forced me to face up to a reality I’d never dreamed of before; that this, the little unassuming wafer, was the most important thing in the world."
"Reading through the encyclical again, holding it up next to the current situation in Rome, makes it easier to clarify certain critical issues."
"Given what we are now seeing, consider the poignancy of the following passages:"
"When dealing with the restoration of the sacred liturgy, the Fathers of the council, by reason of their pastoral concern for the whole Church, considered it of the highest importance to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this Most Holy Mystery, to offer it with the priest to God as a sacrifice for their own salvation and for that of the whole world, and to find in it spiritual nourishment."
"Who, reading this passage, does not feel the urge to shout down the years, to do something to stave off the disaster that was coming:"
"[W]e are aware of the fact that, among those who deal with this Most Holy Mystery in written or spoken word, there are some who with reference either to Masses which are celebrated in private, or to the dogma of transubstantiation, or to devotion to the Eucharist, spread abroad opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no little confusion about matters of faith."
"It is as if everyone were permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the Church, or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved."
"Keeping Cardinal Ottaviani’s Intervention directly before our thoughts, we read with a strange kind of helpless dread…"
[…]
"And therefore, so that the hope aroused by the council, that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole Church, be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions, we have with apostolic authority decided to address you, venerable brothers, and to express our mind on this subject."
[1]
Those of us writing similar jeremiads now have been working to clarify that the attack from Rome on the moral doctrine of the Church isn’t about marriage.
It’s about the Eucharist and to a lesser extent the priesthood.
This knowledge – that the attack is on the Body and Blood of Christ – can also help readers spot their friends in the crowd.
The places where Eucharistic adoration is still offered are places where at least some flicker of the true Faith survives.
"The bishops and priests now talking about the supreme glory of the Eucharist, and the need to defend it from sacrilege, are lighthouses."
"A case in point is Bishop Mark Davies, of my own former diocese of Shrewsbury in England."
"In March, 2016, in the midst of the shouting from Rome, Bishop Davies spoke at his Chrism Mass said that only through the “reality of the Eucharist” could new vocations to the priesthood be found."
“In treasuring this gift of priestly celibacy we need to recognize more clearly the intimate link between the Ministerial Priesthood and the reality of the Eucharist.
It’s almost as if someone had slipped a copy of the Ottaviani Intervention inside his morning paper.
It’s a “stitch-up” as the English call it; a fix.
"You make it a matter of “mercy” (backed up by the iron fist) that no one in a state of objective mortal sin can be refused Holy Communion; you give the national bishops conferences the power to start enforcing this, and you have created a previously unimaginable situation in the Church."
"You have created a regime in which a refusal to desecrate the sacred species will be grounds for persecution of faithful priests, seminarians and laity."
"And of course, we are seeing it starting already."
"It’s a brilliant strategy, the magic bullet that will revert the Church to the 1976 model on every front, and very likely keep it there forever."
As if the goal was to go back in time and erase the entire John Paul II/Benedict XVI period out of history.
"It will halt the revival of eucharistic piety among seminarians; in fact, it will reverse the general reforming trend of “conservative” seminaries that was such a feature under John Paul II and has for 30 years been the hook upon which all hopes of restoration have hung."
It is easy to see what is coming next.
"Once certain announcements are published in parish bulletins, laity will have to consider whether they can, in conscience, continue to assist at Masses where systematic sacrilege has been formally adopted as the rule."
"Not being a theologian I have no idea if this encyclical is, as so many of these seemingly orthodox documents of that period seem to be, rife with the usual “time bombs,” ambiguities, mushy language or even outright errors."
I haven’t looked it up.
I’m sure there are plenty of people out there qualified to examine it to see if it’s safe for Trad-Catholic consumption.
"And I have no doubt at all that there are better, more venerable, even more sublime and poignant works on the Eucharist in the canon of “official” things."
"From saints and Doctors of the Church and whatnot, many of which the pope cited."
"O God, in Your infinite mercy, forgive and have mercy on Pope Paul VI Montini for whatever neglect or damage of which he may have been guilty."
"In this one case at least, a work of his was the exact right thing at the exact right time."
For me at least it was the key that opened the Door to Narnia.

New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”
It should be clear by now that the entire official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people dead and hundreds injured is falling apart.
"From shooter Paddock’s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny."
In the last 24 hours the Sheriff’s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.
"Originally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack."
"As it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite."
"The security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor."
"Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said."
"Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes."
Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor.
"And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities."
"What’s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre."
The hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw “multiple gunmen.” The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre
"As of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times:"
"The new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important:"
Why did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?
"Paddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes."
Police didn’t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped – which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.
"Moreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor?"
Or is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic?
"According to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high:"

Number Of Puerto Rico Residents Without Clean Water And Electricity Keeps Rising
"Newest reports from the island territory now show that the number of residents without clean drinking water and electricity continues to rise, despite humanitarian efforts."
"Puerto Rico’s government has reported that roughly 10 percent of the islands 3.4 million United States citizens are without electricity Tuesday morning, an increase of about six percent from Monday."
"Yesterday, 84% of people in Puerto Rico had no power (per govt stats on status.pr)."
"Today, it's gone up, to 90% without power."
"pic.twitter.com/5WnCA8mrhf — Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) October 11, 2017"
"The island’s electrical grid was all but completely destroyed during Hurricane Maria, and many are still struggling without the most basic of necessities."
This news comes just one day after Puerto Rico’s Governor Ricardo Rossello asked the federal government for an additional $4.6 billion in funding beyond the Trump administration’s request last week for $29 billion from Congress for relief efforts.
The White House also announced Monday that it would allow a 10-day waiver temporarily blocking the Jones Act to expire.
Officials still expect it to be six more months before electricity can be fully restored to Puerto Rico.
Many are now fleeing to the mainland United States just so that they can survive.
"The economy in Puerto Rico is at a standstill, and without clean drinking water, many are finding life too difficult should they remain on the island and isolated."
"Las Vegas Shooting Victim: “There Was 100% More Than One Shooter,” Gates To Concert Were Locked Shortly Before Attack"
"Las Vegas mass shooting victim Rocky Palermo was shot in the pelvis during the horrific attack and is now speaking out about what he saw and believes happened, including the presence of multiple shooters as well as locked concert gates and police telling frantic civilians to go in the other direction."
"“I definitely do believe that there was 100% more than one shooter, every other person that I’ve talked to that did unfortunately get hit as well, have all said the same things,” Palermo detailed."
"The man then goes on to explain that after being shot he ran “about 200 yards” to hide behind a car, all the while hearing bullets fly past him at what he believes was ground level."
"“I’m waiting and all of a sudden we hear a little whizzing going by us, all of a sudden bullets are just flying by,” he continued."
"When someone is shooting form a horizontal line its just going to keep shooting,” Palermo attempted to explain."
Palermo then specifically heard the gun shots get “closer and closer” before quickly deciding it was once again time to run.
"Shockingly, he then goes on to detail the fact that at the end of the concert the previous two nights everyone had exited a specific way but on the night of the shooting this route was locked down shortly before the attack."
"“Every other night at the concert, everybody kinda exited right off Las Vegas Blvd, that was standard, that was routine, you get out of the concert and you go down to the next casino,” he continued."
"“At 10pm they closed every exit on Las Vegas Blvd, every single one."
"They gated them all closed with chain-link fences, 10:08 the shooting started and we were pigs sitting in a corral."
We only had one exit to go out of…..everyone was just kinda following the sheep.”
Palermo makes clear this confused concert goers who had used the normal exits in the past.
“The same exits we had came in and left Friday and Saturday night were definitely closed.
"There were people that went over there and tried to leave and there were cops that were telling them no, you can’t go out here, you have to go the other way,” he shockingly concluded."
La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara
La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replied to Chris Ferrara’s articles on Fastiggi and Goldstein’s defense of Amoris Laetitia and their criticism of the Filial Correction:
"Fastiggi’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “Wait, Wait, It’s all a mistranslation!”"
Robert Fastiggi • 13 hours ago
"In the article that I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein, we would have done better to speak of the “official” Latin text rather than the “original” Latin text."
"This, though, is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS."
The generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God.
"I explain this in my most recent response to Prof. E. Christian Brugger, which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara:"
Posted on LifeSiteNews:
"Prof. Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man, but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases."
"In his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that “God can be ‘asking’ someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.” Then in a Sept. 28 ‘17 LifeSiteNews article, he states that “the generous response” owed to God is “a certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.” Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains “this conscience” in AL 303, this proves that the “generous offering owed to God” is the recognition that one is living “contrary to “the universal command of the Gospel.”"
Prof. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience’s recognition that “a given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel” and this same conscience’s subsequent recognition of a “generous response owed to God in the present circumstances.” The subject “conscience” might be the same but the object is different.
The “generous response” is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model.
What might be this “generous response?” Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he’s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience.
"Moreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely."
"In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil “marriage” recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence."
We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that “the generous response” could be the ending of a particular sin.
Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state.
It’s really just the opposite.
AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin.
"In a recent interview (http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: “Imagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves."
He still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work.
The father is happy.
Is he happy about the fact that the child is sick?
"No, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.”"
This is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.
God is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel.
"God, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction—even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will."
This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law.
It is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning.
Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago
I certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later.
I certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia.
"Rather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them."
What constitutes a “move away” from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin?
No example is provided in AL because none can be.
The notion is nonsensical.
Just how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi’s claim that by “a move away from sin” in the case of a divorced and “remarried” couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children.
But that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself.
"Such a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church’s constant practice, albeit privately to avoid scandal."
"At any rate, the “brother and sister” approach to the situation, which is that of Familiaris consortio 84, is certainly not the one advocated by Francis."
"As my article shows, Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and “remarried” people who will continue to live as if they were married, including sexual relations, while “discerning” their situation, this “discernment” being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church."
"Thus, Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines, which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and “remarried” people who believe themselves to be “at peace with God.” And, as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing, “there is no other interpretation.”"
"No amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL: Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church---which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm, not a mere ecclesiastical law, to which everyone is bound in conscience “without exception”---is being overthrown in place after place."
It is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL.

Thank you for your response.
You write well but you do not reveal a proper understanding of what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.
Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 16 minutes ago
"Tell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio, all of whom you insult with your superficial and I must say entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what Francis is clearly doing."
Fastiggi’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “More Fake News: La Stampa Tries Again.”
Robert Fastiggi • 12 hours ago
I would like to thank Christopher Ferrara again for calling attention to an article I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein in La Stampa.
I give him credit for his colorful style.
"Unfortunately, Mr. Ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that Pope Francis “wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in 'second marriages' to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations.”"
In fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of “access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist.” This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion.
The same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara.
Pope Francis defers to the exposition of Amoris laetitia by Cardinal Schoenborn given in April 2016 when the exhortation was made public.
"Once again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession."
"With regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis."
"Moreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks."
This seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations.
"As a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence."
"As a Christian, he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness."
"Beyond these considerations, I wish to express a personal concern I have about Mr. Ferrara's standing in the Catholic Church."
"This, though, is the very definition of schism found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2089 and the 1983 CIC canon 751."
I hope Mr. Ferrara can clarify what he means by the “Leviathan Church” under Pope Francis.
A more simple question to him would be this: “Are you refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff or communion with the members subject to him?”
I apologize ahead of time if I misconstrued his words.
"I believe, though, my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a “Leviathan Church” distinct from “the dictates of the Immortal God in heaven.”"
Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago
"If Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend, despite a growing mountain of evidence, that Pope Francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to Holy Communion--just as he did when Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in Argentina—then I cannot help him."
"To make it clear for him, I am contending that he and his co-author treat the Pope as if he were the absolute ruler of Hobbes’s Leviathan."
"I do not, as should be obvious, argue that this Leviathan Church actually exists."
That it does not and cannot exist is precisely my point.
"Raising objections to a papal document because it appears to depart from sound orthodoxy is hardly “refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff,” who has not, at any rate, actually commanded anyone to “submit” to anything via AL."

Security Guard Jesus Campos Shot During The Vegas Massacre Raises New Questions About Official Narrative
"The infamous security guard at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, who was allegedly shot stopping the massacre in Las Vegas over a week ago is not listed or registered as such."
"Jesus Campos, who the narrative is constantly changing around, is still a source of mystery."
So who is Jesus Campos?
"That burning question has bothered many since the release of his name, but there’s been no photograph of this alleged hero, even though we’ve already seen crime scene images of the guns Stephen Paddock allegedly dragged up to his 32nd-floor hotel room."
"The ever-changing narrative now though, seems to swirl around this unknown mystery security guard."
"At first, Campos, a guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was hailed a hero for helping guide police to gunman Stephen Paddock’s room on the 32nd floor."
Police said Campos was shot in the leg at the end of Paddock’s assault on concertgoers—potentially distracting the gunman and causing him to panic and kill himself.
"But now, questions have been raised after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline and said Campos had actually been shot about 9:59 p.m. a (full six minutes before the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.) which means the guard could have instead led Paddock to start opening fire on the crowd for fear of being caught."
"Police have said it was difficult to identify the source of the bullets during the attack, and the confusion added more minutes to their lengthy response."
But the revised timeline shows officers would have known where Paddock was before the mass shooting even started.
Did Campos call 911?
What happened during those six minutes?
Much of Campos’s story and background remains a mystery.
–Newsweek
"Campos’s co-worker Liliana Rodriguez started a GoFundMe account for him on October 3, explaining that he’d been shot while on “random patrol” and it could have been anyone of us."
"“Funds will be used to provide relief and financial support for him while he gets back on his feet,” Rodriguez’s online petition says."
“This is a young man that I work with day in and day out.
Any financial support would be appreciated for the time he would need to recover.”
"Strangely, a picture of Campos wasn’t displayed as part of the fund because Rodriguez indicated that “due to privacy from the media we do not feel comfortable publishing a photo.”"
Their own narrative is quickly shattering.
"Las Vegas Metro Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill explained more about Campos’s actions the night of the shooting, helping fill in some of what happened ahead of the attack, but unfortunately, it only added more questions and gave little in the way of answers."
"McMahill told KNPR, a local NPR affiliate, that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm."
"While on the 32nd floor, he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance."
Campos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd.
A maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor.
"As the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle."
"And still, none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either, and why the timeline is being changed publically."

Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre
"During the confessional, a Canadian man by the name of Jeff detailed the fact that he and his wife were in the Bellagio Resort and Casino around 11:20pm on the night of the shooting when panic broke out in the hotels lobby."
Jeff begins the interview by making clear his belief that there were multiple active shooters targeting different places in Las Vegas on the night of the attack.
"“First of all, I think what needs to be said is that, from my perspective, there were multiple events that occurred around Las Vegas, up and down the Strip that night."
"It wasn’t just centralized around the Mandalay Hotel,” the witness claimed."
The eyewitness then goes on to directly say that he and his wife were involved in an active shooter situation at a different hotel that authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover-up.
“My wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating our 10th anniversary and on October 1st we were involved in an incident with an active shooter at the Bellagio.
"There is no mistake in my mind about it,” he continued."
"“All of a sudden there was just a crescendo of screams that started behind us in the lobby,” he claimed."
“Then I heard somebody yell ‘there’s a shooter!
"There’s a shooter!’ And then I heard like five or six pops, like unmistakable gunfire, unmistakably.”"
“That was about 11:20 when we heard the shots and the screams… at that point you could hear and see the screams and see hundreds of people coming towards us.”
"Amazingly, as Shepard Ambellas noted, “The man’s claims match up to actual events captured in police audio recordings from the night of the shooting which confirms that between 11:15 and 11:18 p.m. on the night of Oct. 1 there was, in fact, something going on at the Bellagio.”"
"This testimony also backs up claims by another eyewitness, Rene Downs, who has spent the past few days doing interviews about a shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel."
Two DREAMERs Caught Smuggling Illegal Aliens
"The distinction between the illegal aliens who benefited from Obama's illegal amnesty and other illegals has always been a matter of rhetoric, not substance."
And illegal aliens are not a racial or ethnic group.
They're an industry: an economic industry and a political industry.
Meanwhile DREAMERs continue violating the law.
In more ways than one.
"Customs and Border Protection said the first smuggling attempt was broken up on Oct. 4, after Border Patrol agents stopped a car at a checkpoint on Interstate 35 and discovered two illegal immigrants from Brazil hiding in the trunk."
"The driver of the car was from Guatemala, a juvenile who had been approved by the Obama administration for a DACA permit in 2016."
Three days later the same checkpoint snared another DACA recipient from Mexico smuggling an illegal immigrant from Mexico in his trunk.
Neither of the Dreamers’ names were released.
"They and the illegal immigrants they were trying to smuggle are all being processed for deportation, CBP said."
"Dan Fishback: It's Okay to Boycott Israeli Plays, But Not Okay to Boycott BDS Plays"
"Every time a BDS activist faces a boycott, the #BDStears come out."
The latest outbreak of #BDStears comes from Dan Fishback and his supporters.
Here's my article on the subject.
The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history.
"Coming up in late October is “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?” The two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel."
"In December, the AJHS will feature “Rubble Rubble”, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel."
Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council.
His goal is to “normalize Jewish anti-Zionism”.
AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission.
The JVP events have been canceled That includes Fishback's Rubble and Rubble.
And Dan Fishback is flooding the media with #BDStears.
"""I have grown accustomed to feeling unwelcome in Jewish spaces,"" Dan Fishback whines."
"Him, the PLO and the KKK."
I was raised to believe we were a people of dissent and argument.
"I was taught that it was important to ask difficult questions, and that it was noble to stand up for what you believed in."
Anti-Israel activists like Dan Fishback are entitled to exploit Jewish spaces for their propoaganda... even while they advocate a boycott of the Jews of Israel.
Previously Dan Fishback had authored an article arguing for boycotting some Israeli plays.
"""it’s not that BDS is “censoring” work — it’s that BDS is resisting a propaganda campaign that was intentionally crafted to influence international politics,"" Dan Fishback claimed when advocating a boycott of some Israeli plays."
It's not that boycotting Dan Fishback censors work.
It's time for the #BDStears crowd to examine their entitlement and recognize that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Las Vegas Shooting: A THIRD Timeline Emerges
Editor's Note: This is probably a reason why reporters Laura Loomer and Mike Tokes were barred from entering the presser.
They would have posed real genuine questions of Sheriff Lombardo and forced him to stumble all over himself in answering them.
"A well-coordinated, meticulously planned attack on concertgoers leads to the murder of 58 Americans at a country music festival in Las Vegas, with over 500 injured, and they have no explanation or motive."
How can they possibly hold those two contradictory ideas at the same time?
"The sheriff, alluding to allegations of a conspiracy between his department, the F.B.I., and MGM — supposedly in an effort to establish a legal case — said, “there is no conspiracy.”"
William Jacobson explains the latest “revise” by the authorities is the now infamously botched Vegas investigation:
"October 13, 2017, Legal Insurrection"
Police and hotel still don’t agree on some details.
"I realize that in the heat of a shooting, particularly a mass shooting, it may take some time for a precise timeline to develop."
But it didn’t take very long for the Las Vegas police to release a precise timeline.
"The initial timeline was that Stephen Paddock’s shooting stopped when, approximately 6 minutes after he started, he was interrupted by a security guard from the Mandalay Bay hotel."
"Paddock then turned his fire into the hallway, firing some 200 bullets, and after that the shooting stopped as police arrived."
That was Version No.
1.
"Some days later, the Las Vegas police backed away from that timeline, and stated that the security guard actually arrived 6 minutes before Paddock started shooting into the crowd 32 stories below him."
That was Version No.
2.
"But now that is disputed, in Version No."
3.
WaPo reports:
"The confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said."
"Lombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman’s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended."
"MGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said…."
"Lombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m."
This six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments.
"Police said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing."
"MGM, though, said it was “confident” that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and “was derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.” The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor."
"On Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company’s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier “wasn’t inaccurate when I provided it.” Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log."
"Upon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m."
"The guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock “in close proximity to” 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued."
"Clear, right?"
"Not so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock’s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below?"
Las Vegas police say they didn’t get to the floor until after the shooting was over.
"But MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot."
The discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught….
"… on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and “immediately responded.” MGM said that “Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio."
"As to Paddock’s motive, still nothing from the investigation."
Article posted with permission from Pamela Geller
"By now, we have all heard of Jesus Campos."
"He’s the heroic security guard that allegedly located the Las Vegas shooter, Steven Paddock."
"Of course, this leads many to believe that Campos didn’t even exist, to begin with."
"Once he saw Campos, Paddock reportedly fired nearly 200 rounds through his suite door, wounding Campos in the leg."
"Moments later (6 minutes actually, according to the newly revised timeline regarding Campos) Paddock allegedly opened fire on a crowd killing more than 50 and injuring nearly 500."
But Campos has been a mysterious subject since being wounded in the first moments of Paddock’s assault.
"After speaking to hotel and law enforcement officials, Campos was scheduled to appear on local Las Vegas television for an interview but went missing just moments before he was supposed to be on the air."
"David Hickey, a spokesman for the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America (SPFPA), Campos’s union, said he got a text that Campos had been taken to an urgent care facility, UMC Quick Care."
He also isn’t listed on the registry that shows the names of licensed security guards in Nevada.
"“Right now I’m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is."
"It’s highly unusual,” Hickey told media."
"“I’m hoping everything is OK with him and I’m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something,” he said."
"And, according to the latest reports, are still looking for a motive for the shooting."

"The informant, who is so far only known as “Confidential Source 1,” says that when he attempted to come forward last year with information that linked the Clinton Foundation directly to the scandal he was promptly silenced by the FBI and the Obama administration."
"Working as a confidential witness, the businessman made kickback payments to the Russians with the approval of his FBI handlers and gathered other evidence, the records show."
"Sources told The Hill the informant’s work was crucial to the government’s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by Russian nuclear officials on U.S. soil that involved bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and extortion."
"In the end, the main Russian executive sent to the U.S. to expand Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear business, an executive of an American trucking firm and a Russian financier from New Jersey pled guilty to various crimes in a case that started in 2009 and ended in late 2015."
Toensing added her client has had contact from multiple congressional committees seeking information about what he witnessed inside the Russian nuclear industry and has been unable to provide that information because of the NDA.
"“He can’t disclose anything that he came upon in the course of his work,” she said."
The information the client possesses includes specific allegations that Russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the Obama administration’s 2010 approval of the Uranium One deal and sent millions of dollars in Russian nuclear funds to the U.S. to an entity assisting Bill Clinton’s foundation.
"At the time, Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State on the government panel that approved the deal, the lawyer said."
"It has been previously reported that Bill Clinton accepted $500,000 in Russian speaking fees in 2010 and collected millions more in donations for his foundation from parties with a stake in the Uranium One deal, transactions that both the Clintons and the Obama administration denied had any influence on the approval."
"In the midst of the new discoveries revealed yesterday about the Uranium One case (see: FBI Uncovered Russian Bribery Plot Before Obama Approved Uranium One Deal, Netting Clintons Millions), “Confidential Source 1” has once again hired an attorney, Victoria Toensing, a former Reagan Justice Department official and former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to get his story out."
"“All of the information about this corruption has not come out,” she said in an interview Tuesday."
"“And so my client, the same part of my client that made him go into the FBI in the first place, says, ‘This is wrong."
What should I do about it?’”
"The undercover client witnessed “a lot of bribery going on around the U.S.” but was asked by the FBI to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that prevents him from revealing what he knows to Congress, Toensing explained."
"They said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an NDA,” she added."
"As we pointed out last summer when Peter Schweizer first released his feature documentary Clinton Cash, the Uranium One deal at the center of this scandal is believed to have netted the Clintons and their Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations and ‘speaking fees’ from Uranium One shareholders and other Russian entities."
"Russian Purchase of US Uranium Assets in Return for $145mm in Contributions to the Clinton Foundation – Bill and Hillary Clinton assisted a Canadian financier, Frank Giustra, and his company, Uranium One, in the acquisition of uranium mining concessions in Kazakhstan and the United States."
"Subsequently, the Russian government sought to purchase Uranium One but required approval from the Obama administration given the strategic importance of the uranium assets."
"In the run-up to the approval of the deal by the State Department, nine shareholders of Uranium One just happened to make $145mm in donations to the Clinton Foundation."
"Moreover, the New Yorker confirmed that Bill Clinton received $500,000 in speaking fees from a Russian investment bank, with ties to the Kremlin, around the same time."
"Needless to say, the State Department approved the deal giving Russia ownership of 20% of U.S. uranium assets."
"Meanwhile, the ‘journalists’ over at CNN are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly who spent the $100,000 on Facebook ads…"

"The Kurds have no friends but the mountains, is an old lament ."
"Last week, it must have been very much on Kurdish minds."
"As their U.S. allies watched, the Kurdish peshmerga fighters were run out of Kirkuk and all the territory they had captured fighting ISIS alongside the Americans."
The Iraqi army that ran them out was trained and armed by the United States.
"The U.S. had warned the Kurds against holding the referendum on independence on Sept. 25, which carried with 92 percent."
Iran and Turkey had warned against an independent Kurdistan that could be a magnet for Kurdish minorities in their own countries.
But the Iraqi Kurds went ahead.
"Iraq, which George W. Bush and the neocons were going to fashion into a pro-Western democracy and American ally, appears to be as close to Iran as it is to the United States."
"After 4,500 U.S. dead, scores of thousands wounded and a trillion dollars sunk, our 15-year war in Iraq could end with a Shiite-dominated Baghdad aligned with Tehran."
"With that grim prospect in mind, Secretary Rex Tillerson said Sunday , ""Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fight against ... ISIS is coming to a close ... need to go home."
"Any foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home."""
"Tillerson meant Iran's Quds Force in Iraq should go home, and the Shiite militia in Iraq should be conscripted into the army."
Consider what is happening in Syria.
"The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, largely Kurdish, just annihilated ISIS in Raqqa and drove 60 miles to seize Syria's largest oil field, al-Omar, from ISIS."
The race is now on between the SDF and Bashar Assad's army to secure the border with Iraq.
Bottom line: The U.S. goal of crushing the ISIS caliphate is almost attained.
Would President Trump be willing to fight a new war to keep Iran from consolidating its position in Iraq and Syria?
"If Trump and his generals felt our vital interests could not allow Syria and Iraq to drift into the orbit of Iran, where would we find allies for such a fight?"
"Saturday, Israel launched new air strikes against gun positions in Syria in retaliation for shells fired into the Golan Heights."
Why would Israel wish to provoke a war with Syria?
Because the Israelis see the outcome of the six-year Syrian civil war as a strategic disaster.
"Hezbollah, stronger than ever, was part of Assad's victorious coalition."
Iran may have secured its land corridor from Tehran to Beirut.
Its presence in Syria could now be permanent.

Will Trump Continue the CIA’s JFK Cover-Up?
"Last Friday, President Trump made the following announcement:"
"I have decided not to block release of the CIA’s remaining JFK-assassination related records except for those records that directly implicate the CIA in the assassination, which will continue to remain secret.”"
"Okay, he didn’t really put it like that."
"But that’s the potential and likely import of his announcement, which actually read as follows:"
"Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” (Italics added.)"
"The operative words, of course, are: “Subject to the receipt of further information….”"
What is going on here?
Negotiations.
The art of the deal.
The CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long-secret JFK-related records.
It has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination.
"Under long-established custom and tradition in Washington, D.C., when someone asks someone else for a favor, the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return."
That’s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play.
Trump wants something in return.
We don’t know what — maybe laying off on the Russia investigation — but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations.
Time to buy old US gold coins
What Trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the CIA: “Give me what I want and I’ll give you want you want.
Make no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made.
The CIA will cave.
It will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants.
"All this will happen by this Thursday, the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked."
"Think about it: The CIA has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or, apparently, some relating to secret correspondence between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board back in the 1990s."
The CIA’s ground?
National security?
Really?
The CIA says that releasing its decades-old JFK records will reveal secret “methods” of intelligence gathering.
That should be big news.
"You see, the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination."
"Such being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on “national security” grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president."
"Let’s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA, in partnership with the military and the Mafia, orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence, either Navy intelligence, the CIA, or the FBI, or a combination of all three."
"Don’t forget, after all, that that’s what Oswald said."
He said he was being framed.
"Now, let’s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed."
"In that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up."
"It would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald’s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades."
"The first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald’s bona fides was the DRE, an anti-communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact."
"What no one knew at the time, and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades, was that the DRE was a CIA front organization."
"It was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides, which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s, the House Select Committee in the 1970s, and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s."
But there was another big operation to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides before the assassination.
"It had to do with Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies."
"Today, Oswald’s Mexico City trip, which is part of those CIA records ready to be released, is still shrouded in mystery."
The CIA’s continued secrecy in the JFK assassination is no big surprise.
"As I wrote in my October 11 article, “Will Trump Make a Deal with the CIA on JFK Records?,” the CIA is between a rock and a hard place."
Do the CIA’s long-secret records contain a video-taped confession?
Of course not.
And they don’t contain any reference to assassinating Kennedy.
The CIA’s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state-sponsored assassination into writing.
But there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years.
"In 1953, the CIA was in the process of developing a top-secret manual on assassinations, one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state-sponsored assassinations."
Too bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves.

"Millions of residents still don’t have access to electricity or proper health care, and bacteria in the water have exposed many people to disease."
"“Even before Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the U.S. territories, the islands’ health care system was suffering from the ongoing economic crisis."
"The senators stressed that much of the islands’ power and communication networks are out and, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), it will take months before power is fully restored."
"Hospitals have been forced to prioritize patients, ration services, and forgo elective surgeries."
"The power grid’s failure has caused more problems than many anticipated, like the stall of relief efforts."
"Without electricity, communications are non-existent too."
"Some 33 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico, only 23 percent of residents have electricity, according to Status.pr, which provides daily updates on basic services on the island."
The different ways that the lack of electricity can set off a cascade of other crises is becoming increasingly clear.
"A giant government-owned hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, arrived in Puerto Rico weeks ago to help out, but many people don’t know about the ship."
"Without electricity, most cell phone towers are down."

South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout’s David Duke Day
"Last month, once again, Zakkout chose to showcase this work by posting four consecutive Duke videos on his (Zakkout’s) personal Facebook page."
The postings can be rivaled only by Zakkout’s own documented bigotry.
Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA).
He has ties to two dozen mosques stretching from Palm Beach County down to Miami-Dade.
"On September 21, 2017, Zakkout took to Facebook and posted four David Duke videos."
This was not the first time Zakkout has promoted David Duke.
"Indeed, he has done so for years."
"In July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring another anti-Semitic Duke video on the AMANA website."
David Duke’s bigoted and inciting material is not the only hate Zakkout promotes.
"He also pedals much bigotry coming from others, including himself."
"In July 2017, Zakkout posted on his Facebook page a four-minute portion of a speech given by Louis Farrakhan at the Nation of Islam’s February 2017 Saviors’ Day."
"The tree is speaking to the man in Arabic, saying “Oh Muslim!"
Oh Muslim!
There is a Jew behind me.
Come and kill him.”
A photo from the report shows the burning towers with a Jewish Star affixed to one.
"The report begins, “It ain’t debatable!"
"In December 2015, Zakkout posted a photo of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot, who is a decorated veteran of many different wars and battles fought by Israel over the last three-plus decades."
"In July 2014, Zakkout organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami."
"On video, Zakkout is shown smiling, as event goers repeatedly shout, “We are Hamas.” After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: “Thank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!” He signed it “Br."
Sofian Zakkout.”
"South Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout’s promotion of bigotry, whether borrowed from others or his own, has been evident for years."
"Yet, there is no outcry from the community, not from Muslims, not from non-Muslims."
"It has been virtually ignored by everyone, save this author and his colleague, Director of Militant Islam Monitor Beila Rabinowitz."
"Despite their having been notified by this author about Zakkout’s perfidious activities, Zakkout remains an active member of the boards of Citizens’ Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County and Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County."
These organizations have provided and continue to provide Zakkout with a facade of respectability.
It is time for Zakkout to be exposed and stripped of his public functions.
"Beila Rabinowitz, Director of Militant Islam Monitor, contributed to this report."
Jewish students have already faced plenty of harassment and hate at McGill.
Third-year student Noah Lew was one of 12 board members up for general assembly ratification on Monday evening following his victory as vice-president finance of the Arts Undergraduate Society.
"The ratification vote is typically a mere formality, but Monday’s was different due to Democratize Student Society of McGill University (SSMU), an organization that was established to resist the university’s ban of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement on campus."
Democratize SSMU was able to pass a motion that required each board member to be voted upon separately under the grounds that they weren’t a fan of the names.
"When it was Lew’s turn, he was voted down, 105 to 73 with 12 abstaining, with applause following the vote."
"Two other students who had criticized BDS, Alexander Scheffel and Josephine Wright O’Manique, were also voted down."
"Democratize SSMU had targeted Lew and the other two students on the board because they had connections to the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee (CJPAC) and were involved in getting the BDS ban passed, which Democratize SSMU claimed were “conflicts of interests.”"
Somehow I don't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest.
Lew shared the experience on Facebook.
"“I was blocked from being able to participate in my student government because I am Jewish, because I have been affiliated with Jewish organizations, and because I believe in the right to Jewish self-determination.” Lew added that the experience shows the inherent anti-Semitism in the BDS movement."
There are some more details here and a petition.
"On Monday night, three students were removed from the Board of Directors of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), McGill’s main student government."
All three were targeted for removal either because they are Jewish or have vocally opposed anti-Jewish discrimination on campus.
"Indeed, according to eyewitnesses, one of the members of the mob that removed the three directors was Igor Sadikov."
Antisemitism at McGill does not emerge from a vacuum.
"If the Daily is committed to systematically excluding the voices of an ethno-religious community on campus, then it cannot continue to receive automatic student funding, as it does now."
The double standard here is pretty clear.
The JFK Cover-Up Continues
"While the mainstream media was announcing for the past two weeks that President Trump was going to release the CIA’s long-secret records on the JFK assassination, I took a different position."
"On Monday of this week, I predicted that Trump would make a deal with the CIA that would enable the CIA to continue its cover-up of the JFK assassination."
(See “I Predict Trump Will Continue the CIA’s JFK Assassination Cover-Up” and “No Smoking Guns in the JFK Records?”)
"On Thursday, the day of the deadline established by law for releasing the records, Trump granted the CIA’s request for continued secrecy, on grounds of “national security,” more than 50 years after the Kennedy assassination."
"Please, don’t start calling me Nostradamus."
"On Thursday, the deadline established by law for releasing the records, the CIA undoubtedly blinked and Trump presumably got what he wanted in return for granting the CIA request for continued secrecy."
Time to buy old US gold coins
Some mainstream media commentators are criticizing the CIA for waiting until the very last day to make its case for continued secrecy.
JFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing.
The fact is that the CIA put in its request to Trump for continued secrecy of its JFK records long before yesterday.
"Don’t forget: According to Trump’s own tweets, he had already ostensibly decided to deny the CIA’s request for secrecy before the Thursday deadline:"
"Trump tweet sent on Saturday, October 21: “Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” Trump tweet sent on Wednesday, October 25: “The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow."
Not likely at all!
"In the negotiations, both Trump and the CIA knew that Trump was in the catbird seat."
The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
"In the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would."
Trump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel.
"As I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place."
What did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump’s extending the CIA’s 50-year-plus secrecy?
"We don’t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia."
Here’s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump’s supposed “collusion” with Russia are about to fizzle out.
"That’s because I believe that the CIA, as part of its deal with Trump, will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation."
"In my opinion, that’s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963."
Notice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April.
"Ostensibly, the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to “national security.” Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing."
"For more than 50 years, the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret."
"During the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s, the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years."
There are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible.
"Finally, the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago."
"So, why the April deadline?"
"Why not extend the secrecy for another 25 years, which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted?"
Because Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal.
"If Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years, he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain."
"Let’s say, hypothetically, that I’m right: that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation."
"To make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain, Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA."
"If the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain, Trump releases the records in April."
"If the CIA squelches the Russia investigations, Trump grants another extension of time in April."
"For anyone who has a mindset of conformity and deference to authority, that story makes sense because nothing is questioned or challenged."
"For example, how many communist Marines have you ever heard of?"
"Why would a genuine communist join the Marines in the first place, especially since the Marines had just recently killed millions of North Korean communists?"
"Why would a genuine communist join the Marines knowing that he could be called upon at any moment to go to Korea, Laos, Vietnam, Europe, or elsewhere to kill fellow communists?"
How many communists do you know who like to kill fellow communists?
It gets better.

"The entire U.S. anti-communist crusade, including Vietnam, which more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died killing communists."

That information was that Oswald was actually working for U.S. intelligence.
"Yes, a spy, the type of people that work for the CIA."
"That would make sense, especially given that the Marine Corps is a prime recruiting place for the CIA."
Semper fidelis!
"Now, suddenly, all the circumstantial evidence in the Kennedy assassination falls into place."
It begins to make sense.
"Unlike JFK, who had begun withdrawing troops from Vietnam, Johnson would The Man Who Killed Ken... Roger Stone Check Amazon for Pricing."
protect national security by sending more troops to Vietnam.
"But to avoid detection, they needed a patsy, which is the term that Oswald used after his arrest."
They needed to frame someone for the crime.
And what better person to frame than a communist or an intelligence agent who the public would believe was a communist?
"Part of the scheme, obviously, would be to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides."
"That’s why he was sent to New Orleans, where, contradictorily, he would work for a right-wing business owner, work with a right-wing former FBI agent, and conduct a public protest in favor of Fidel Castro and Cuba."
And guess what is included in the records that Trump has now agreed to continue suppressing.
You guessed it!
The CIA’s records relating to Mexico City!
"And neither would it have done so if Trump had not granted the CIA’s request for a continued cover-up of what it did on November 22, 1963."

ICE removes Guatemalan national wanted for murder
NEW YORK — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) removed a Guatemalan citizen Wednesday who was wanted in his home country on charges of homicide.
"Rigoberto Gonzalez-Aragon, 66, was returned to Guatemala City, via an ICE Air Operations charter flight, and transferred to the custody of Guatemalan law enforcement authorities."
"On March 9, ERO New York received a lead from the ICE Assistant Attaché for Removals in Guatemala that Gonzalez-Aragon was wanted for homicide and residing in the New York metropolitan area."
"On June 8, ERO deportation officers arrested Gonzalez-Aragon in Spring Valley, New York, for immigration violations."
He had previously entered the country unlawfully at an unknown date and time.
He had been in ICE custody since his June arrest.
"In September, he was ordered removed by an immigration judge, paving the way for his deportation."
Ninety-two percent of individuals removed from the interior of the United States had previously been convicted of a criminal offense.

"A 28-year-old man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after he was convicted of providing material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Justice Department said Friday."
"Mohamad Jamal Khweis from Alexandria, Virginia, was convicted by a federal jury in June."
The Justice Department said Khweis left the U.S. in 2015 and eventually crossed into Syria through Turkey late that year.
Khweis spent 2.5 months as a member of ISIS in northern Syria.
"In 2016, he surrendered to Kurdish forces in northern Iraq and was eventually turned over to U.S. authorities, the department said."
… The department said Khweis used encrypted devices and mobile applications to hide his activity.
"After joining the militant group, he agreed to be a suicide bomber, prosecutors said…."
"“There wasn’t anything that would lead me to believe that this was, like, on the radar, that he was just going to go join ISIS.”"

First American Citizen To Be Convicted Of Joining ISIS Gets 20 Years
The first American citizen to be convicted of successfully joining the Islamic State has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"Mohamad Khweis, unlike the dozens of other people in the United States who failed to join ISIS and were subsequently charged, actually made it to Syria, but after just three months tried to escape and was captured by Kurdish forces, The Washington Post reports."
Khweis is an interesting case for numerous reasons.
"First, there was no particular event or friend who ignited his radicalization."
"Second, he successfully made it to Syria via Turkey."
"And third, he came from a secular home that was stable."
His life before joining the caliphate was unremarkable.
"He obtained an associate’s degree in criminal justice and worked as a bus driver in Alexandria, Va."
He also abused marijuana over the past few years.
Khweis’ defense attorney said Friday that even he has no idea what caused Khweis to join ISIS.
"“It’s difficult to understand,” defense attorney John Zwerling said Friday."
“We don’t really know what caused him to travel to Syria.”
"“I hated myself for making the worst decision I ever made,” Khweis wrote to the judge in a letter."
"Prosecutors, who pushed for 35 years in prison, accused Khweis of lying repeatedly over the last 15 months of the trial."
"When Khweis was first captured in Iraq in March 2016, he told the FBI that he was following a young woman."
"However, that young woman didn’t exist."

Local Police & Feds Impose INFORMATION BLACKOUT in Las Vegas Shooting
There already was a blackout on the worst mass murder in modern American history.
Where is the outrage?
ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Vegas slaughter.
ISIS does not claim credit for events that are not theirs.
They have double and tripled down on their claim.
"They have said that Stephen Paddock had converted to Islam six months ago, and they revealed his Islamic name as Abu Abd Abdulbar al Ameriki."
Paddock made multiple trips to the Middle East.
The FBI has not spoken of his itinerary or who he met with.
His girlfriend Mari Danley had relatives in Dubai.
Over 200 of Paddock’s foreign financial transactions were flagged for possible covert terrorism financing.
"Paddock transferred $100,000 to his girlfriend in the Philippines, now an ISIS foothold."
Paddock removed the hard drive before he committed suicide.
The San Bernardino jihad attackers did the same thing.
"If you recall, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik threw their hard drives in a lake near their home, and despite Herculean efforts by law enforcement, the hard drives were never recovered."
"AUTHORITIES PUT BRAKES ON INFORMATION FLOW IN LAS VEGAS SHOOTING By Rachel Crosby Las Vegas Review-Journal, October 26, 2017: Fifty-eight people killed."
More than 500 injured.
It wasn’t always like this.
"In the days after Oct. 1, when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd from his Mandalay Bay corner suite, Las Vegas police were hosting multiple news conferences a day."
"Then, once a day."
"Then, once every few days."
They compiled and released snippets of officers’ body camera footage.
They spent several minutes answering specific questions.
"They released a comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong."
"They took it back, and tried to clarify the errors, but instead caused more confusion."
By Oct. 13 — the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public — something had changed.
"The sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative."
"Both he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions."
"Since that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman’s room."
His platform to share that information?
"“The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” which aired last week."
He hasn’t made himself available to the media since.
"“It doesn’t matter,” FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks."
"“It’s an ongoing investigation, and unless there’s something to report, there will not be a briefing.” Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office."
"At least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation."
"Both times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department’s director of communications, that the sheriff “will not be conducting interviews.” “As he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing” she said in an email Thursday."
"“Another media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.” When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks."
"The Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation."
"“Investigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock’s life for the last few years — and they’re still not done,” Alston said."
"“We still have officers dedicated to this case 24/7.” She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, “but they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation … that has filled so many news stories the past month.” Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman’s motive remains a mystery."
"More straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay — where the gunman was staying — has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman’s hotel room and homes."
"Authorities also have not said how long the gunman had a “do not disturb” sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it."
"Though authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case."

SO MUCH FOR MERCY & DIALOGUE: Member of Vatican International Theological Commission Sacked for Questioning Pope of Mercy & Dialogue
The Catholic Twitterverse is alive today with criticism of the USCCB’s decision to sack Fr.
"Thomas Weinandy, the former head of their doctrinal office."
Or at least to stop attacking them.
"In a letter made public November 1st, Fr."
"Weinandy, a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops’ Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican’s International Theological Commission, warned Pope Francis that he has caused “chronic confusion” among the faithful and bishops."
"In an interview yesterday with John Allen’s Crux, he added, more prophetically than he had perhaps intended, “I don’t think anyone can, or should, associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops."
"Neither was involved in my writing the letter, and its publication will be news to them.”"
"And sure enough, within hours of making his letter public, we learned that Fr."
"Of course, the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony: how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns, was immediately fired."
Political consultants often ask: how does it look?
"As though the fog of irony weren’t thick enough, in response to the outrage from Catholics, the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis’ cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account."
"Which, it must be said, only proves Fr."
Weinandy’s point once again.
Some of the criticism has been unusually sharp.
Fr.
"Just as Tom Weinandy has, in effect, just said.”"
"In his letter, Fr."
Weinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis’ agenda.
"In fact, a former student of his wrote to me today saying,"
“I see that Fr.
Thomas Weinandy has been squashed.
"He was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild-mannered, least confrontational, kindest academics one could have hoped to meet."
"To me, the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant."
"He is neither a traditionalist, nor a controversialist, but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear-thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching."
I would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter/exercise of conscience.
I imagine that it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence.”
"When I posted it, this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw, the head of the UK’s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction, who wrote, “This is absolutely right."
Not a man to seek out confrontation.”
The Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr.
Weinandy’s concerns.
He said the pope is…
Fostering “chronic confusion.”
“Demeaning” the importance of doctrine.
Our friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read.
Fr.
"Weinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31, the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola."
"Like the Dubia cardinals, he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months."
"Notable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour, his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people."
"The pope, he said, seems “to censor and even mock” critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching, and in doing so is committing a “kind of calumny…alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry.”"
"In an interview with Crux, Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but “more concerned about the good that my letter might do.” The letter “expresses the concerns of many more people than just me, ordinary people who’ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions."
I wanted them to know that I listened.”
"In fact, Fr."
"Which inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear, nor so pastoral."
"When Cardinal Muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the CDF, the conservative Catholic world wailed that it was another case of a “good” prelate being got rid of."
But his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of Catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span.
Ed Pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about Muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he’s on.
"Most recently, on October 30th, Crux quoted him under the headline, “Cardinal Muller backs Pope Francis against critics of ‘Amoris Laetitia’” in which the former head of the CDF has at last climbed on board the Kasperian train on reception of Communion for unrepentant adulterers."
"Or sacrilege either, I guess."
Or something.
"Somehow the “new evangelization” is involved in this, though it’s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege OK. Also, it’s very important to fulfill the Sunday Mass obligation, and as everyone knows, one can’t possibly go to Mass on a Sunday without receiving Communion."
"Anyway, the result of this is a “marriage-like relationship” about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things."
Or be too “extreme”.
Because that could be too polarizing.
And mean.
"And anyway, sins of the flesh aren’t the worst things ever."
"There are, like, “different levels” of gravity, you know?"
"And, like, it depends on the type of sin, right?"
"“Spirit’s sins” like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff, are worse than “sins of the flesh,” you know?"
"Which are, like, only a result of “human weakness,” right?"
"Apparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the Kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way, way, WAY out of proportion, and the “polarization” it has caused has been “regrettable”."
"Muller, with little backing from Pope Benedict – who appeared content to allow his CDF prefect and the Germans shout out their differences – and with outright opposition from Francis, did indeed strive to hold the line."
The fact that Francis orchestrated the Synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault.
And it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time.
"But since then, Muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit, instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides."
With this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his October 30th essay too seriously.
Perhaps one of the good effects to come from Fr.
Weinandy’s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the Catholic Church is supposed to act.
"As my friend said, maybe “it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence,” assuming there are any left."

"[1] In this interview, Fr."
"Weinandy gave a remarkable story of how his prayer for a “sign” that he ought to write the letter was very specifically answered: “If you want me to write something, you have to give me a clear sign,” Weinandy recalls saying."
"“Tomorrow morning, I’m going to Saint Mary Major’s to pray, and then I am going to Saint John Lateran."
"After that, I’m coming back to Saint Peter’s to have lunch with a seminary friend of mine.” “During that interval, I must meet someone that I know but have not seen in a very long time, and would never expect to see in Rome at this time."
"That person cannot be from the United States, Canada or Great Britain."
"Moreover, that person has to say to me, ‘Keep up the good writing’.” Weinandy said, exactly that happened the next day, in a chance meeting with an archbishop he’d known a long time ago but not seen for over twenty years, who congratulated him for a book on the Incarnation and then said the right words, “Keep up the good writing.” “There was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something,” Weinandy said."
There Were “Active Shooters On The Runway” Bombshell Air Traffic Control Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals
"The audio recordings, taken from the night of the October 1st massacre that left 58 dead and over 500 injured, are further proof that multiple shooters were used throughout the area, a fact that directly contradicts the official story."
"During the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of “The New Right” Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself."
"“Shutting down might not be a good idea, there’s active shooters on the runway,” he declared."
"“The 19s are closed, we are in the process of trying to round them up, they are on the airport property.”"

"While there have been countless stories since the attack that raise the very real possibility that this was a false flag, one has stood out due to the fact that the person who released the information died shortly after."
"As Shepard Ambellas reported in a now viral article, “Kymberley Suchomel, who posted her eyewitness account of the Las Vegas massacre in astonishingly vivid detail to her Facebook page on Oct. 4, subsequently passed away in her home on Oct. 9 from what reports are claiming are natural causes.”"
"“Shockingly, just days before her death, Suchomel posted key details about the shooting to Facebook that contradicted the official narrative which claims that Stephen Paddock was the lone gunman.”"
It is also important to keep in mind that multiple investigative reports conducted by other alternative media outlets have actually named government officials and private companies that may be behind the attack and so far there has been no official denial from either.
The Cunning CIA
"This shouldn’t surprise anyone, given that practically from its inception in 1947 the CIA was specializing in the arts of assassination, regime change, and cover-up."
It came to light in 1997 as a result of a Freedom of Information request.
"Today, Americans can read the CIA’s assassination manual online."
"Titled “Study of Assassination,” the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people."
Here is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms:
"Firearms are often used in assassination, often very ineffectively…."
Public figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion.
The propaganda value of this system may be very high.
Time to buy old US gold coins
The manual also makes it clear that the CIA was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected.
Note the following excerpt:
"For secret assassination, either simple or chase, the contrived accident is the most effective technique."
"When successfully executed, it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated."
It would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual.
That’s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination.
We can also assume that the CIA continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone.
The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob G Hornberger Best Price: $9.85 Buy New $9.95 (as of 03:35 EDT - Details)
"As part of the Guatemala regime-change operation, the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated."
"While the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination, there is little doubt that Arbenz, the president, was at the top of the list."
There is something important to note: Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so.
"So, why were they targeted for assassination?"
"Because Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as John Kennedy would do ten years later."
That’s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination.
The CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting “national security” by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general.
"Tracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA’s second-highest medal."
"The doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front."
"At a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound — the one in the front of Kennedy’s neck — was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front."
"This necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated."
"Keep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence."
But he also went a step further.
He said that he was being framed for the crime.
The obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front?
"Wouldn’t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?"
"If Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front."
Who would those confederates be?
How would we know this?
That’s where Oswald’s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play.
Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
Oswald traveled to Mexico City where he purportedly visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the Soviet Union.
"Keep in mind that this was the height of the Cold War between the United States and that the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, had taken place the previous year."
"So, President Kennedy has been assassinated."
Oswald is immediately arrested.
What does all that mean?
An assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war.
"In the early days of the Warren Commission, commission chairman Earl Warren called a top-secret meeting of the commission."
Its purpose was to discuss information that Warren had received that Oswald was actually a U.S. intelligence agent or an informant for the FBI or both.
How did Warren resolve this troubling issue?
He simply asked the heads of the CIA and FBI whether it was true.
They said no.
That was the end of the matter.
He ordered all notes and other written references to be destroyed.
He also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting.
"Unbeknownst to him, the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light."
"BELIN: Well, now, the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the CIA was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of President Kennedy."
"During the time of the Warren Commission, you were Deputy Director of Plans, is that correct?"
HELMS: I believe so.
"BELIN: Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an age[nt.… The CIA, Terrorism, an... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing."
That’s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the CIA that were recently released by the National Archives.
"Shapira points out, “Several news organizations, including The Washington Post, seized on the truncated file as an example of the government’s continued secrecy about the assassination.” Shapira points out that Helms’ full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994."
"(The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board, the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies."
"The ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone’s movie JFK, which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime-change operation, no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before.)"
"Shapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave, which, as he points out, has been public:"
"HELMS: Mr. Belin, this question, and I think you may recall this, was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever, and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald."
"As far as the FBI was concerned, my recollection is not all that precise."
I believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either.
He was certainly not an agent of the CIA.
He was certainly never used by the CIA.
Whether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I don’t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable — I believe Mr. [John] McCone [a previous CIA director] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point.
I believe he was asked to testify.
It was a hot item anyway at the time.
And my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA.
Perjury.
"A CIA official who would tell falsehoods, even under oath, whenever he felt that “national security” required it."
The reason?
"Allende was reaching out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as Arbenz had done and just as Kennedy had done."

It has no value at all.
How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist?
"If Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s, given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War?"
"Why would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered, on a moment’s notice, to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam, Laos, China, the Soviet Union, or Europe to kill communists?"
Don’t forget: this is the height of the Cold War!
Why wouldn’t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians?
How is it possible that Oswald could learn fluent Russian while serving in the U.S. military without having U.S. military tutors teaching him?
We can assume that any frame-up by the CIA is going to be good.
The operation is going to be carefully planned and executed.
Things are inevitably going to go wrong.
The pieces aren’t going to fit together perfectly.
The Mexico City operation is a good example of that.
"But here’s another example, a small but important one: Recall that Oswald supposedly hid the rifle before he headed down the steps from the sixth floor of the school book depository."
"Ask yourself: If someone has just assassinated the president of the United States, is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle?"
What good would that do?
Wouldn’t officials conduct a thorough search of the area?
Wouldn’t an assassin instead simply leave the rifle there and get out of there as soon as he could?
The framers had to hide the rifle in advance in a place where no one CIA & JFK: The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.
"would see it during the morning of the assassination, which took place after noon."
"No matter how good a frame-up was, the CIA knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation."
They had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frame-up would remain intact.
"The idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald’s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately, especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting, in partnership with the Mafia, to assassinate Castro."
"As soon as Oswald is assassinated, the FBI orders Wade to turn over all his investigative files to the FBI."
"At the same time, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately."
"Johnson appoints former CIA Director Allan Dulles, who Kennedy had fired as a result of the CIA’s regime-change operation at the Bay of Pigs, to the Warren Commission, thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the CIA."
"Then keep all the records secret for decades, when many people won’t care anymore who killed President Kennedy."
And employ Operation Mockingbird-like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative “conspiracy theories” to confound and confuse the public.

The Best of Jacob G. Hornberger
An Anti-Semitic Purge At McGill University
"At the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School’s student society."
This is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill.
Lew followed the advice and was elected as a board member.
His “secret” was intact.
"Finally, in June 2016, SSMU’s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill’s undergraduate student union constitution."
"The Board’s ruling, which is called a “reference,” was then referred to SSMU’s directors for ratification."
Campus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called “Democratize SSMU” movement.
Its raison d'être was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU’s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda.
"As an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against “Zionists.” As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill’s Arts Undergraduate Society."
McGill’s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances.
"In October, SSMU’s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors."
"According to Lew, “historically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.” But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol."
"In this manner, BDS/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time."
"But this time, they may have gone too far."
BDS activists generally avoid reference to “Jews” by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute “Zionists” for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions.
"Even SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members."
"One can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action."
New Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals That There Was “Another Active Shooter” In The Bar At The Top Of The Mandalay Bay Hotel During The Attack
"Newly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history."
"The audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel."
"Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction."
“We have a firefighter’s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay.
"We are trying to get further on the name,” dispatch frantically notes."
"“Batallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.”"
"After being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from."
"“The only information I have is it’s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay,” dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or “just sheltering right now?”"
"Interestingly, the story doesn’t end there, as Ambellas wrote in his piece, author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place."
The popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room.
"Cardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that the Mandalay Bay was telling visitors that there was at least one active shooter, “moving” throughout the hotel shooting people."
It was reported by the Mandalay there was a shooter moving through the hotel.
"I told Elena and Johnny, “stay close to me, we are not running out, stay calm, there is one person in charge — where I go, you follow, no matter what.” […] About this time, there was starting to be a lot more activity through the casino and now the reports suggested there was active multiple terrorists moving through the hotel shooting guest."
"Then twitter started showing up with feeds suggesting multiple hotels being attacked, bomb threats, and more."
"This new report documenting yet another instance of a possible second shooter comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports, with the most recent arriving in the form of air traffic control audio that directly stated that there were active shooters on the runway."
"“During the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of “The New Right” Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself,” SHTFplan reported."
"“Shutting down might not be a good idea, there’s active shooters on the runway,” he declared."
"“The 19s are closed, we are in the process of trying to round them up, they are on the airport property.”"

﻿Vatican Theologian Sacked for Questioning “Merciful” Pope’s Pontificate
"The former head of the theological secretariat of the U.S. Bishop’s conference, Fr."
Weinandy has taught at both Oxford and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
None other than Francis appointed Fr.
"Weinandy to the International Theological Commission and awarded him the Pro Pontifice et Ecclesiae medal, the ecclesial equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, for his work on behalf of the Pope and the Church."
"One of the world’s most renowned theologians, Fr."
Weinandy is a “man of the Council” and a prominent figure of the post-conciliar mainstream.
Yet Fr.
"The key passages (paragraph breaks added) rebuke Francis for his recklessness, his deliberate ambiguity, his fomenting of error, his sowing of disunity, his unheard-of calumnies of the faithful, and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology—precisely the wrong of which he accuses orthodox Catholics:"
This fosters within the faithful a growing unease ….
"In ""Amoris Laetitia,"" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous, thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching…."
"The Holy Spirit is given to the Church, and particularly to yourself, to dispel error, not to foster it."
This kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry….
"Such behavior gives the impression that your views cannotsurvive theological scrutiny, and so must be sustained by “ad hominem” arguments."
[T]oo often your manner seems to demean the importance of Church doctrine.
"Again and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish, and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life."
"Your critics have been accused, in your own words, of making doctrine an ideology."
"But it is precisely Christian doctrine… that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic, life-giving Gospel."
"Those who devalue the doctrines of the Church [i.e., Francis!]"
"separate themselves from Jesus, the author of truth… What they [i.e., Francis] then possess, and can only possess, is an ideology – one that conforms to the world of sin and death."
"[F]aithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops, men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them."
"What scandalizes believers, and even some fellow bishops, is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church, but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice…."
"As a result, many of the faithful, who embody the ""sensus fidelium,"" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd."
"[T]he Church is one body, the Mystical Body of Christ, and you are commissioned by the Lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity."
But your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite….
You have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church.
"You have frequently encouraged… all persons, especially bishops, to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think."
"But… what many [bishops] have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it… Many fear that if they speak their mind, they will be marginalized or worse."
"I have often asked myself: ""Why has Jesus let all of this happen?"""
Father Weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven.
"As he recounts here, after repeatedly “beseeching Jesus and Mary, St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today, a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused,” he asked for a minutely specific sign from heaven on whether he should write the letter: that the next day he would meet someone he had not seen in a very long time, would never expect to see in Rome, and was not from the United States, Canada or Great Britain, which person would utter the particular phrase: “Keep up the good writing.”"
"At lunch the next day, the sign was given."
"An old friend he had not seen in more than twenty years and would never have expected to meet in Rome, who is now an archbishop, appeared suddenly from between two parked cars, renewed acquaintances and, referring to one of Father Weinandy’s books, said: “Keep up the good writing.”"
Writes Fr.
Weinandy: “I could hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes.
But there was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something.
I also think it significant that it was an Archbishop that Jesus used.
I considered it an apostolic mandate.”
Can we doubt that it was indeed an apostolic mandate?
Can we not see in Fr.

"As if to confirm the validity of his own indictment of this pontificate, only a day after this letter was published, the USCCB demanded that Fr."
Weinandy resign his current position as a consultant to the U.S. bishops.
He has done so.
Fr.
"Fessio’s Catholic World Report, another voice of the rising mainstream opposition to Francis, notes that “In making such a request, the USCCB, it would appear, reinforces Fr."
Weinandy’s very point about fearfulness and lack of transparency.”

"Weinandy’s intervention gives us hope that the plan to remake the Church according to the mind of Bergoglio will ultimately encounter a resistance that will bring an end to the Latin American-style dictatorship Francis has imposed upon the Church, even as he speaks of dialogue, collegiality, decentralization and parreshia (but only for those who agree with him)."
The plan that ultimately must fail may well fail even while Francis is attempting to carry it out.
May Our Lady of Fatima intercede soon to thwart the designs of Francis and to rectify the grave harm he has already caused.

Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?
Traditionalists are often derided by neo-Catholic commentators for relying on supposedly apocryphal quotations from Popes or saints bearing on the current ecclesial crisis.
"But these critics never demonstrate that the oft-cited quotations are apocryphal; they merely assert that they must be, as they seem too probative to be true."
"Take this quotation of Pius XII, for example, speaking in 1931 when he was still Monsignor Pacelli, serving as Pius XI’s Secretary of State:"
I am worried by the Blessed Virgin’s messages to Lucy of Fatima.
"This persistence of Mary about the dangers which menace the Church is a divine warning against the suicide that would be represented by the alteration of the faith, in her liturgy, her theology and her soul…."
"A day will come when the civilized world will deny its God, when the Church will doubt as Peter doubted."
She will be tempted to believe that man has become God.
"When I first cited this quotation some 17 years ago, I was contacted by a very prominent neo-Catholic luminary who demanded a source for it, because he and his friends believed it was “apocryphal.” I did not receive the courtesy of a thank-you when I pointed him to pp."
52-53 of Msgr.
"Roche’s biography of Pius XII, Pie XII Devant L’Histoire (Paris: Editions Robert Laffont, 1972), an out-of-print French-language work I managed to obtain after an extensive search of used book seller inventory."
The French original text confirms the accuracy of the English translation I had seen before I cited the statement.
"A Modernist apostate priest, one Emile Poulet, who left the priesthood and married, attempted to cast doubt on the credibility of Msgr."
Roche’s account of the words of the future Pius XII.
"Small wonder: Poulet, who died in 2014 at the age of 94, belonged to the “worker-priest” movement that none other than Pius XII had condemned, as I note here."
"A short time before the holy Father’s [St. Francis’] death, he called together his children and warned them of the coming troubles:"
"“At the time of this tribulation a man, not canonically elected, will be raised to the Pontificate, who, by his cunning, will endeavour to draw many into error and death."
"Then scandals will be multiplied, our Order will be divided, and many others will be entirely destroyed, because they will consent to error instead of opposing it."
"“There will be such diversity of opinions and schisms among the people, the religious and the clergy, that, except those days were shortened, according to the words of the Gospel, even the elect would be led into error, were they not specially guided, amid such great confusion, by the immense mercy of God…."
"“Some preachers will keep silent about the truth, and others will trample it under foot and deny it."
"Sanctity of life will be held in derision even by those who outwardly profess it, for in those days Our Lord Jesus Christ will send them, not a true Pastor, but a destroyer.” [paragraph breaks added]"
"This quotation appears in Works of the Seraphic Father, St. Francis of Assisi, published in 1882 by the London-based Catholic publishing house R. Washbourne, 1882, pp."
248-250).
It is readily available as a Google book.
"The same book, it must be noted, contains an appendix setting forth “Doubtful Works of Saint Francis,” of which the quotation is not part."
"Thus, the publisher itself carefully distinguished the authentic prophecies of Saint Francis from what might be apocryphal."
"""St. Francis in Ecstacy"", Caravaggio, 1595"
"Saint Francis’ prophecy is clearly not a prediction of the Great Western Schism (1378-1417), which did not involve a “destroyer” on the Chair of Peter who leads the faithful into error, widespread apostasy, and the persecution of faithful Catholics as “schismatics.” But it does contain elements very familiar to us today."
"Something else to consider: Saint Francis, one of the greatest saints in Church history, one of the few who is known and revered by the whole world, freely revealed his vision of an ecclesial destroyer who usurps the papal office."
"That is, Saint Francis did not suffer from the currently reigning papolatry, which holds that the indefectibility of the Church depends upon defending every word and deed of a given Pope as somehow consistent with Tradition and declares absolutely inadmissible the idea that the holder of the Petrine office could be a threat to the integrity of the Faith."
"Rather, Saint Francis, illuminated by heaven itself, recognized the coming reality of what Saint Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church, hypothesized as possible in principle, to cite another “apocryphal” quotation:"
"Just as it is licit to resist the Pontiff that aggresses the body, it is also licit to resist the one who aggresses souls or who disturbs civil order, or, above all, who attempts to destroy the Church."
I say that it is licit to resist by not doing what he orders and by preventing his will from being executed…

"Ryan Grant (Mediatrix Press: 2015), Book II, Chapter 29, p. 303."
Did Saint Francis predict the coming of Pope Francis?
"That is not for us to judge, although the Church may­ well issue a judgment of Francis like that of the posthumous anathema of Honorius­­ I."
Would Saint Francis have been horrified by the words and deeds of the Pope who has presumed to take his name?
Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows “Helicopter Hovering Overhead” During The Attack
"Newly released footage of the Las Vegas Massacre, captured by a private surveillance camera and recently released by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, has once again ignited the theory that helicopters were used during the horrific attack."
"Over the last month multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were and now, with this latest evidence release, that possibility seems all the more plausible."
"As Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub, “The [footage] is presumed to have been captured by a nearby business’s southward facing security camera which is located approximately 780 feet due east of the venue where the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was held on Oct. 1."
The tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims.”
"“Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 and 10:16 a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera,” Ambellas continued."
"“By 10:14 much larger crowds of people can be seen streaming through the area to escape the massacre going on,” Carlson reported."
"“You can see a large amount of wind and debris, apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead.”"
"The footage goes how to show two men attempt to help a victim who had apparently been shot, eventually resorting to covering up the body after they realized it was simply too late."
Ambellas also reported on what his research indicates were documented helicopters in the air at the time.
"A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen."
"However, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer."
"In fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead."
"As I have reported in the past, multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used throughout the city."
"“Footage has emerged that may show muzzle flashes coming from the helicopter in what looks to be evidence that a team was firing into the crowd from the air on that fateful night,” read a report in The Daily Sheeple."
It is also important to keep in mind that there is footage of a still unidentified team loading up gear in a helicopter near the scene of the attack.
"Additionally, Carlson also noted during the initial broadcast of the private surveillance footage that the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI, who have so far never seen the footage, much less investigated it."

"Here’s proof, from Australia."
"All 746 undergraduate history courses taught at Australia’s 35 universities in 2017 were analyzed and it was found that, classified by thematic keyword in course titles and content descriptions, the most common themes were ‘Indigenous’ issues (99 references, 13% of total courses), followed dutifully by ‘Race’ (80), ‘Gender’ (69), ‘Identity’ (55), ‘Women’ (46), ‘Islam’ (39), ‘Colonization’ (39), ‘Sexuality’ (34) and ‘Ethnicity’ (34)."
"Lagging well in the rear were such staples, now mere historiographical curiosities, as ‘Liberalism’ (7), ‘Capitalism’ (8), ‘Industrial’ (11), ‘Communism’ (15) and ‘Democracy’ (21)."
More history courses study ‘Sexuality' than either ‘Enlightenment' (20) or ‘Reformation' (12).
More courses study ‘Islam' than ‘Christianity' (34).
"Anyone who still thinks that political, intellectual, demographic and material factors are what really matter to history, and to society, ought to get with the multiculturalist/Identity Politics program – enroll in a history course at an Australian university today!"
"Now, more than a year after the investigations began, it’s looking less likely than ever that President Trump did anything wrong… but the investigations seem to be zeroing in on key Clinton team members (including the Clintons themselves)."
"On Tuesday night Fox News Sean Hannity sat down to talk about the exploding scandal that is the Uranium One deal, and what it could mean for the Clinton family."
"Hannity spoke with investigative reporter Sara Carter of Circa, John Solomon of The Hill, and Victoria Toensing, an attorney representing the FBI informant who allegedly possesses documents on the sale of Canadian mining company ‘Uranium One’ to Russia interests back in 2010."
Now that the NDA (non disclosure agreement) has been lifted Circa’s Sara Carter is “reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia’s involvement in uranium one.”
"Apparently, Solomon has learned that the FBI informant “has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin’s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further."
Go into your report.”

And Sara Carter reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia’s involvement in uranium one.
"Also joining us now is the attorney for the FBI informant, Victoria Toensing along with John and Sara."
"Sara, let’s start with your report."
"SARAH CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: It is Sean."
"I mean there’s over 5,000 documents which include emails, briefs, other documentation, memorandums that the informant had turned over to the FBI and Justice Department, and within these documents, it’s very evident of Russia’s intention to enter the American market, energy market."
And their intentions to acquire uranium one.
"HANNITY: John, you go into extensive detail in a very long and hard-hitting piece tonight and revealing piece, how the FBI informant — you actually said six years, I thought he was only an informant for four years."
"He has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin’s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further."
Go into your report.
"JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: You know, Sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market."
This is an email that the FBI has had for six years.
That would put the United States at a disadvantage.
That is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now.
"If you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department, there’s no connection to uranium one."
These are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files.
They said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case.
"We now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009, a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration."
There are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don’t agree with.
HANNITY: All right.
"I got a very high ranking Congressman and that knows, let us put it that way, and actually sent me a note."
"The knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you, and the links to the Clinton foundation."
"Sara, is that true?"
CARTER: I believe that is true.
I mean especially when we at —
HANNITY: Do believe or you know?
I can’t ask Victoria that question because she won’t tell me.
CARTER: I know it’s true.
"I know that looking at these documents following the money, following the money is what’s important here."
The Justice Department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this.
This is still out there.
They are looking into it.
That is something that they need to decide.
"But whether it’s a special counsel or whether it’s a prosecutor that is investigating this, they will be able to follow the money."
There are somethings said …
"HANNITY: When you say follow the money, my suspicion would go to the money came directly from Russia, was funneled through the Canadian donors to the Clinton Foundation."
How good are my instincts?
CARTER: You have pretty good instincts.
I think there’s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well.
And that is what’s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation.
HANNITY: But it is beginning to cascade Sara.
CARTER: It is.
"HANNITY: John, I want her to respond to the same thing, that the Clinton Foundation, that this will be traced back to high-ranking Obama administration officials and the Clinton Foundation, and if you add the money portion Sara mentioned?"
SOLOMON: I do.
I think the place we will be talking about in the next couple weeks as the Clinton global initiative.
Sort of a side project of the Clinton Foundation.
There are new flows of money there that we will report on then the next couple of weeks.
It will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks.
Another layer of interest of the story.
HANNITY: All right.
We have a lot of time in the segment so I want to go very slowly here.
"Both of you, before I get to Victoria, Sara and John, you both in your pieces said 5,000 documents."
"I hear the number the FBI informant is much, much greater, tens of thousands."
True or false?
SOLOMON: That seems to be accurate.
We have a subset of the documents and they are very voluminous.
HANNITY: Now let me go to Victoria.
One of the great attorneys.
She is the most difficult to get any information out of.
"Victoria, one of the things I’ve known about you, and I’ve interviewed you so many times over the years, you now have been doing a deep dive into all of this."
You are now representing this FBI informant.
"VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT: Let me go to number one first, that is the whole essence of what John and Sara and I are talking about is that in 2009, 2010, our FBI and presumably our Justice Department, and the White House, as my client was told, all knew about this corruption in the Russian nuclear energy area."
There’s no separate companies.
They are all related.
They are all one.
They all talk to each other.
"So the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009, 2010, and why is it that CFIUS either wasn’t told, or CFIUS people knowing about it —"
"Uranium, why was that decision made?"
Was CFIUS told?
Did Bob Mueller go to Eric Holder and tell him?
Eric Holder sat on it.
HANNITY: He was one of the nine.
TOENSING: Did Bob Mueller go to the White House and tell him?
The FBI agents told my client that they were briefing the President about his conduct.
"Of course, when the CFIUS decision was made."
"My client said, what happened?"
"HANNITY: Back to my original question, counselor, if I may."
You are too good at your job.
This is a very serious point.
"Putting your legal hat on, objectively speaking, yes they knew, the evidence will prove it based on the documents and your client, crimes committed on a high level?"
National security compromise?
I think that we are going to have to do is continue to follow the money because the reporting that John and Sara are going to be doing in a few days will be revealing about where lots of the various money went and where it came from.
"HANNITY: Always we go back, and I believe at the end of this you guys deserve a Pulitzer, and I’m not the only one thinking that."
"You have dug so deep on this, this has been a deep dive and I applaud you both."
"I want to ask as it relates to who knew what, and when."
"What did they know, when did they know it, John Solomon?"
"I’m talking about Obama, Mueller, Eric Holder, and Hillary Clinton."
"SOLOMON: We are at a little disadvantage right now, because we don’t have those records, and also the records that Congress needs to go get, but I can tell you I have a person quoted in my story who has direct knowledge of what the Justice Department knew."
HANNITY: President daily briefings were told.
Had this information in it before CFIUS approves this.
CARTER: Sean.
That is what we need to find out.
We need to see those Presidential daily briefings.
Congress can get those.
"They will be able to know whether or not President Obama was briefed on this and according to a number of people that I have spoken with as well, he was."
"I think that will reveal a whole other layer of who knew what, where and when."
"And we follow the money and it will reveal even more about Hillary Clinton and what she knew and when did she know it, and the other members of the CFIUS board."
HANNITY: And Obama and Holder and Mueller?
"John, real quick, we are running out of time."
"SOLOMON: yes listen, I think even Sessions and Rosenstein have questions to answer."
There are people in Congress who don’t think they’ve gotten a straight answer from them.
HANNITY: All right.
"Victoria, we get the last word from you, laws broken?"
"TOENSING: Well, of course."
HANNITY: You are so good at your job.
You are so annoyingly good.
Newt Gingrich will weigh in on this and more things and about the Clintons.
Are they facing their day of reckoning?
And a big announcement at the end of the show.

ICE Deports Guatemalan Man Wanted For Assassination
"SPRINGFIELD, Mo."
"— A Guatemalan man, wanted by law enforcement authorities in his home country for killing a store owner, was removed Thursday by deportation officers."
"Jose Manuel Ohajacao-Ramos, was transferred Nov. 9 to the custody of Guatemalan law enforcement officials by ERO officers in Guatemala City, Guatemala."
"According to Guatemalan authorities, Ohajacao-Ramos is accused of fatally shooting a store owner in his store in June 1997."
Guatemalan law lists the charge as an assassination.
Ohajacao-Ramos legally entered the United States in 1998 as a visitor and overstayed his temporary visa by more than 18 years.
"He was arrested at his home in Neosho, Missouri, in May 2017."
"In September, a federal immigration judge ordered him removed to his home country."
Ohajacao-Ramos remained in ICE custody since his May arrest.
"“Removing foreign fugitives trying to escape law enforcement in their home countries is an ICE top priority,” said Ricardo Wong, field office director for ERO Chicago."
“The cooperation between the U.S. and our Guatemalan counterparts resulted in returning this man who is a threat to public safety.”
Ninety-two percent of individuals removed from the interior of the United States had previously been convicted of a criminal offense.
Asteroid Will Skim By Earth Days Before Christmas: It Is ‘Potentially Hazardous’
An asteroid called 3200 Phaethon will skim past the Earth just days before many will celebrate with Christmas festivities.
"The three-mile-wide asteroid is expected to miss the Earth, but it’s still labeled as “potentially hazardous,” and for good reasons."
"The asteroid will pass within 6.5 million miles of the Earth, which is relatively close in space terms, but still around 27 times the distance of the moon."
Much closer flybys have occurred in the very recent past.
"Scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are planning to use the opportunity to obtain a detailed 3D model of the asteroid, which has a particularly irregular shape."
"First detected in December 2007, 3200 Phaethon is widely thought to be the parent body for the Geminid meteor shower, which is due to peak this year on the night of December 13."
This would make the Geminids one of only two major meteor showers not originating from a comet; the other being the Quadrantids in January.
The main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition.
"Asteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material."
Comets which approach the Sun lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail.
But the real question is will anyone be able to see the asteroid’s close approach to our planet.
"According to NASA, 3200 Phaethon will be visible in small telescopes for experienced observers in areas with dark skies."
It is potentially detectable for three weeks but will be at its brightest between December 11 and 21.
"A San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015."
"For Garcia’s Zarate’s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump."
"“For those who might criticize this verdict – there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,” Gonzalez said after the verdict, “the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States."
"Alex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor’s office told reporters the verdict “was not the one we were hoping for,” but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution."
"Attorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant’s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter."
.
.
No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.”
"Mexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times."
In 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation.
San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national.
"On July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old."
"The felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years."
"Since Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks."
San Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.
"Should that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law."
"Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight."
"When that happens, the killer’s public defender will call it a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”"
"In San Francisco, and across California, this verdict will surely give new meaning to the cry of “no justice, no peace.”"

Update 1: AP reports that U.S. immigration officials say they will deport the Mexican man found not guilty of murder in San Francisco pier shooting.
* * *
"As we detailed earlier, in a verdict that has shocked many in the Bay Area (and across America), a jury of six men and six women in sanctuary city San Francisco found illegal immigrant (and five-time deportee) Jose Ines Garcia Zarate not guilty in the death of Kate Steinle."
Mr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions and five prior deportations to Mexico.
"He had been set free from jail only months before the shooting, in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities, who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again."
"Ms. Steinle, known as Kate, a 32-year-old medical equipment saleswoman, was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father’s arms."
"Mr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon, but said it was an accident."
"The bullet ricocheted on the pier’s concrete walkway before it struck Steinle, killing her."
"Zarate has admitted to shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident."
Defense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier… but the stories of what happened copntradicted one another…
"He said it was wrapped in cloth, and when Garcia Zarate unwrapped it, the gun accidentally discharged."
"But in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal."
"He also told police that he stepped on the gun, causing it to fire."
"But still, after six days of deliberation, the illegal Mexcian immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges and also found not guilty of assault with a firearm."
"Garcia Zarate was found guilty of illegal firearms possession, which carries a sentence of 16 months to three years."
* * *
"In a response to the verdict, Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement saying that despite California’s attempt at a murder conviction, Zarate was able to walk away with only a firearm possession conviction because he was not turned over by San Francisco to ICE."
Social media erupted with outrage at the verdict (with very few – if any attempting to defend the verdict)…

UK: Labour MP Cites Ban of Robert Spencer & Pamela Geller in Calling for Trump to be Banned from Country
"The brouhaha over President Trump’s retweets of videos depicting Muslims being violent continues in the UK, and is yet another manifestation of the general tendency to blame those who call attention to jihad atrocities rather than to focus upon the jihad atrocities themselves."
"Trump himself said it best, tweeting yesterday evening:”."
.
"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2017"
"Bryant “cited the cases of two US far-right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller , who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump.”"
Why are we “far right”?
Everything we do is in defense of the freedom of speech and equality of rights of all people before the law.
That’s “far right”?
That’s a demonstrably true statement.
"Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation."
"Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain."
One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
"Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country."
Chris Bryant had nothing to say about any of those jihad preachers entering Britain with no problem.
"“UK ambassador conveys concerns over Trump retweet to White House,” by Rowena Mason, Guardian, November 30, 2017:"
"Bryant, a former Foreign Office minister, said the prime minister should issue a prohibition order against the president like those that apply to other far right figures from the US."
"He cited the cases of two US far right bloggers, Robert Spencer and Pamela Geller, who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the UK to take part in English Defence League rallies, as precedents for taking action against Trump."
"In a letter to May, he said: “I am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country."
"“In retweeting Jayda Fransen’s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity."
This activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets.
"Ms Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal."
Many of the people you have rightly banned from entering the UK were guilty of less than this.”…

"British Labor Party: We Banned Pamela Geller, Now Let’s Ban Trump, Too"
This because Trump retweeted three videos showing Muslims being violent.
"He cited the cases of two U.S. far-right bloggers, Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the U.K."
"We planned to pay our respects to Lee Rigby by placing a wreath at his memorial, in his memory and in memory of his service."
"We planned to bring the Stars and Stripes, as well as British and Danish flags, and participate in Armed Forces Day memorial commemorations at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, where Rigby served."
"For this, we were banned."
The über-left pol citing the Geller-Spencer ban in the U.K. to ban Trump was inevitable.
"It’s like the Geller ban on ads on buses and subways in every major American city: the Catholic Church just tried to run ads on buses in Washington, D.C., and discovered that it couldn’t because of the ban on all political ads that was enacted in order to prevent my ads from running."
"Once you sanction the silencing and persecution of one, inevitably, you’ve sanctioned it for all."
It’s open season on the opposition.

"﻿Communion to Adulterers Promulgated as ""Authentic Magisterium"""
"Last week, Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS)—the Vatican's organ for promulgating the Official Acts of the Apostolic See—published Pope Francis' October 2016 letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires in which he praised their episcopal guidelines allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion in some cases while living in a state of objective mortal sin."
"If papal clarification was ever needed on the long-debated issue of the intended meaning of Amoris Laetitia chapter VIII, such clarification has now been provided for the Church at large."
"Concerning these guidelines that allow ""the possibility of access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist"" in ""complex circumstances"" where ""limitations that lessen the responsibility and guilt"" permit adulterous couples to continue in adultery, the pope said in his letter:"
"Until now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an ""Apostolic Letter,"" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State."
"The rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents—the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines—to bear the character of his ""authentic Magisterium,"" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website."
"Hence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when ""concrete circumstances"" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared ""magisterial"" by the Holy See."
"The problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration."
"St. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: ""If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly."""
"The fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it."
Cardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows:
"Rescript ""from an Audience with His Holiness"""
"The Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium."
"From the Vatican Palace, on the day of June 5 in the year 2017"
Pietro Card.
Parolin
Secretary of State
"The Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: ""Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals."
"Some rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g."
"the interpretation of a law."""
It appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals.
"Pope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it?"
"We shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare ""ex-cathedra"" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as ""extraordinary magisterium."""
"In an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to ""formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope."""
"Burke was reiterating Church teaching, as expressed by famed canonist Franz Wernz in his Ius Canonicum: ""In sum, it needs to be said clearly that a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power upon the very fact."""
San Francisco Show Trial Sequel
"Last week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14."
The jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession.
"Many observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse."
San Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate’s gun possession charge dismissed.
Gonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that “momentary” possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime.
"“If you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn’t be a crime,” Gonzalez told reporters."
"Gonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship."
"As he explained, “I think I was a product of affirmative action,” and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School."
"The La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA’s most high-profile Stalinists."
"In 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors."
You have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don’t like.”
In 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom.
In 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president.
"On that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt."
"In jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three “immigrants,” quite possibly false-documented illegals."
"True to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors."
So observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted.
"As it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger."
"In a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle."
"In another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta."
"This happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead."
Garcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands.
"After firing, he tossed the gun in the water."
"He said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims."
"Even so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter."
Any observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted.
Denunciations of “gun violence” were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak.
"As Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love."
"On the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society."
"In this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die."
"Out for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California."
"As defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”"
"Since Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter."
Any observer of the case could believe it probably will be.
"""When the shepherd becomes a wolf, the first duty of the flock is to defend itself."
"The true children of Holy Church, at such times, are those who walk by the light of their Baptism, not the cowardly souls who, under the specious pretext of submission to the powers that be, delay their opposition to the enemy in the hope of receiving instructions which are neither necessary nor desirable."""
"Francis, writes Royal, “has little use for established procedures, precedents, even legal structures within the Church…."
"When the head of the Church himself does not much feel bound by the tradition or impartial laws he has inherited, what then?” What then indeed?"
"The Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power, Alexander VI being the most popularly known example."
"By publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Francis has officially declared that the “authentic Magisterium” includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will."
"The guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis’s private missive, which is suddenly declared to be “an apostolic letter.”"
The normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate.
"We are now expected to believe that the “authentic Magisterium”—meaning simply and only AL—teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare, solely in reliance on AL:"
"When the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible, especially when both are Christians with a journey of faith, one may propose that they commit to living in continence…."
"In other more complex circumstances, and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity, the aforementioned option may not, in fact, be viable."
"Nonetheless, it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment…."
"[I]f one arrives at the recognition that, in a concrete case, there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability (cf."
"301-302), particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union, Amoris Laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (cf."
notes 336 and 351).
"As Francis would have it, then, the “authentic Magisterium” has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia:"
"The admission of public adulterers in “second marriages” to Holy Communion, which John Paul II, in line with all of Tradition, called “ intrinsically impossible ” given their objective state in life, is now deemed possible depending on circumstances—that is, situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment."
The requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament—a moral norm binding “ without exception ” because it is rooted in divine law—is suddenly demoted to a mere “proposal” that may not be “feasible” or “viable” in “the concrete circumstances of the couple.”
"A valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage, the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse, is now dispensed with in “more complex circumstances… when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity,” the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church."
The meaningless slogan “journey of discernment” cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church’s sacramental life.
"No less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship, blithely referred to as a “new union,” could be “damaged” if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion—evidently because the “new union” would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce!"

"Francis, however, has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the Church."
"The attempt is void, of course, and the appellation “authentic Magisterium” is fraudulent."
"Over the past year, Cardinal Burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon Francis to “clarify” his intention respecting AL."
"That clarification has now been given: Francis intends, if it were possible, to change the unchangeable teaching of the Church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law."
So now it must be asked: Where are the cardinals and the bishops?
"With one or two noble (however inconsistent) exceptions, their response to the Bergoglian Debacle thus far ranges from silence, to active complicity, to—at best—hand-wringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the Church while begging the Pope to “clarify” his already perfectly clear intentions."
Their failure to defend the Faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the Church and the cause of the Gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders.
Prudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity.
"The time for hierarchical action is now, before the damage to the Church becomes irreparable."
Where in our Church are the leaders who can show us the right path?
"What we need today is a new Athanasius, a new Basil, bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against Arianism when almost the whole of Christendom had succumbed to heresy."
"Will none of the hierarchs rise to defend the Church as “a new Athanasius, a new Basil”?"
Even the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the Church or at most the “confusion” Francis has caused by not “clarifying” precisely what he has just clarified.
They avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source.
Concerned clergy and laity throughout the Catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations.
This undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs—first and foremost in the Church—the duty to act.
"Our Lady of Fatima, intercede for us!"
"Cardinal Burke to Michael Matt: ""Amoris Not An Exercise of Magisterium"" (Now what?)"
"Given that Pope Francis has, since that interview took place, attempted to make the Argentine bishops’ interpretation of AL 'magisterial'--an interpretation that allows public adulterers to receive Holy Communion--Cardinal Burke’s reply to my question on January 9th of this year would seem to take on new relevancy."
"In my interview of Raymond Cardinal Burke less than one year ago, I asked His Eminence to clarify what, exactly, is the level of authoritative weight of Pope Francis’s post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia."
"Now, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, president of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, made it very clear to the Catholic News Service on December 5 what the Pope is up to: “The fact that the pope requested that his letter and the interpretations of the Buenos Aires bishops be published in the AAS means that His Holiness has given these documents a particular qualification that elevates them to the level of being official teachings of the church."
"While the content of the pope’s letter itself does not contain teachings on faith and morals, it does point toward the interpretations of the Argentine bishops and confirms them as authentically reflecting his own mind."
Thus together the two documents became the Holy Father’s authentic magisterium for the whole church.”
"The moment, it would seem, has come."
"We thank God for the courage you've shown in defending His Church thus far, and we pray he will continue to bless and protect you as you do what must now be done."
The Sun Is Going DARK: No Sunspots For 96 Days; Ice Age Approaches
NASA’s own data is showing that the star our globe revolves around is dimming.
"With no sunspots reported in 96 days, the sun is going dark and the evidence could point to an approaching ice age."
"As the sun gets successively more blank with each day, due to lack of sunspots, it is also dimming, says the website Watts Up With That?"
"According to data from NASA’s Spaceweather, so far in 2017, 96 days (27%) of the days observing the sun have been without sunspots."
"Today at Cape Canaveral, SpaceXlaunched a new sensor to the International Space Station named TSIS-1."
Its mission: to measure the dimming of the sun’s irradiance.
It will replace the aging SORCE spacecraft.
"NASA SDO reports that as the sunspot cycle plunges toward its 11-year minimum, NASA satellites are tracking a decline in total solar irradiance (TSI)."
–Watts Up With That?
The Daily Sheeple’s Joe Joseph breaks it down for those who don’t closely follow the sun’s changes.
"He says there is a correlation between major changes on the sun and the behavior of the Earth, especially now as it reaches its 11-year-cycle’s solar minimum."
"“I guess you could say, in a very generalistic sense…and I mean, this is as vanilla as you can possibly make it…that as the sun gets quieter so does our magnetic field get weaker or so it appears to be,” says Joseph."
“Is there a mini ice age coming?
"I don’t know,” he said."
But other sources say it’s more than possible that we will see a mini ice age in the next three years due to the dimming of our sun.
"A 15-YEAR long mini ice age could be due to hit the Northern hemisphere in just four years as the sun prepares for “hibernation” – triggering a barrage of cataclysmic events, says The Express UK in 2016."
"Solar activity, measured by the appearance of sun spots, has been declining at a greater rate than at any other time in history."
And that could have widespread implications.
Research by the The Space and Science Research Center in Florida revealed a strong link between low solar activity and seismic events.
Scientists say that it could take up to 15 years for solar activity to return to normal with extreme weather and freezing temperatures continuing until 2035.
New Footage From Las Vegas Massacre Reveals Possible Muzzle Flashes From Helicopters That May Have Conducted “Air Assault”
What appears to be muzzle flashes emitting from multiple aircraft can be seen on numerous videos captured on the night of the massacre.
LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) — Newly released footage of the October 1 massacre posted on YouTube by the NICK VEGAS channel appears to confirm what Intellihub’s founder and editor-in-chief Shepard Ambellas pointed out in late October when he presented evidence of the strategic air assault on The Alex Jones Show in great detail.
"The video shows what appears to be muzzle flashes emanating from the airspace between the Delano Hotel and Mandalay Bay, an airspace that should be free of obstruction altogether."
A major analysis of this matter was done by Ambellas in mid-November which revealed that no aircraft should be occupying that airspace between the hours of 10:05 and 10:15 p.m. on the night of the shooting (i.e.
no aircraft are visible on the radar in that airspace during that time.)
Not to mention the fact that helicopters are not allowed to hover in the City of Las Vegas without a permit nor are they allowed to lurk behind buildings lower than their roof lines.
"The first of a series of muzzles flashes can be seen coming from several different elevations, possibly from as many as 3 aircraft (helicopters)."
The flashes which are not consistent with FAA required running lights in any way can be seen starting at 0:19 seconds into the video.
Note: To see the flashes you must view the video on ‘1080p’ and set it to ‘full screen’ and look between the two hotels (adjust the video speed to 25%.)
"The exact same aircraft and apparent muzzles flashes can also be seen in the Arch Angel Studios “First Shots” video which was posted to YouTube on Oct. 2, just one day after the shooting."
#LasVegasShooting
"Determined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion, Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium® on his outrageous opinion that in “complex circumstances” wherein it is not “feasible” to live as brother and sister, two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra-marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill-defined “process of discernment.” As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed, this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they “discern” that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery."
Then there is the endlessly double-talking Cardinal Müller.
"It is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience, and with good reasons, of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof."
"In this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament, certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility."
"Moreover, absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal, a purported “second marriage” can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery."
Such cases do not exist.
No priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum.
"Marriage is a public state in the Church, and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church."
"The only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live “as brother and sister”, that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person."
"Even then, the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known, lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments."
Does Cardinal Müller think we are fools?
"Some of us apparently are, or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo-Pharisaical sophistry that would produce “a discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.”"
"Consider the recent declaration by one of Francis’s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life, whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it."
"In a lecture at the Gregorian, one Father Maurizio Chiodi, a “moral theologian” of the post-Vatican II variety, proposed that “an artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out, not in order to radically reject the gift of a child, but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality.”"
"That is, Francis’s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept!"
"(Consider the example of Catholic Answers, which “defends the Faith” while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church."
"Meanwhile, ours is but to keep the Faith and protest before God and man the blows now raining down against the Church, even when they come from a wayward Roman Pontiff at her summit."
"Indeed, especially then."
ICE Arrests 22 In Chicago Area During 3-Day Operation
"CHICAGO — Federal officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 22 criminal aliens and immigration violators in Illinois’ Cook and Lake counties during a three-day enforcement action, which ended Monday."
"During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Illinois cities and towns: Chicago (9), Cicero (4), Hoffman Estates (1), Palatine (4), Park City (1), Rolling Meadows (2) and Round Lake Beach (1)."
All those arrested were men between the ages of 20 and 53.
"Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following five countries: Ecuador (1), Honduras (2), Mexico (17), Serbia (1) and Ukraine (1)."
Six of the 22 arrested during this operation were criminal aliens who were released back into their communities after local law enforcement failed to honor an immigration detainer placed on the individuals by ICE.
Immigration detainers request that ICE be notified before the individual is released from local custody for any reason.
"Most of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: sexual assault, kidnapping, assault, assault with a weapon, drug possession, theft, obstruction of justice and driving under the influence (DUI); two were known fugitive immigration violators, and six were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony."
The following are criminal summaries of the offenders arrested in Illinois during this operation:
A 38-year-old Mexican citizen and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 8 in Rolling Meadows.
He was previously convicted in Cook County for felony aggravated criminal sexual assault and bodily harm.
He was previously deported.
Cook County Sheriff’s Office did not honor the ICE detainer that was placed.
He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.
A 37-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago.
"He was previously convicted twice of drug possession, and he has pending criminal charges for sexually assaulting a child."
He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.
A 20-year-old Mexican man and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 7 in Round Lake Beach.
He was previously convicted of battery.
He is also Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient with two extensions.
"He was served a notice to appear before a federal immigration judge, and will remain in ICE custody pending disposition of his immigration proceedings."
A 32-year-old previously deported Ecuadoran man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago.
"He has criminal convictions for DUI, domestic assault and assault."
He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.
A 46-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago.
He has a criminal conviction for possessing cocaine.
He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.
"Depending on an alien’s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted."
"“This operation focused on targeting immigration fugitives and criminal aliens in two Illinois counties, but we routinely conduct operations daily."
"Indeed, both of these are true."
RT reports:
"He was apparently referring to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Serbia – a common route for migrants heading for ‘wealthy’ Europe."
"“So, they are not running for their lives [in these countries]."
"They are merely economic migrants seeking a better life,” Orban concluded."
"In his view, the government simply can’t go against the will of the people."
RT continues:
"Going further, the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal, for example, adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany."
Orban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ‘open-door’ policy towards asylum seekers.
"“If someone wants to come to your house, he knocks on your door and asks: ‘Can we come in, can we stay?’ They [asylum seekers] didn’t do that, they crossed the border illegally,” he stated."
"Orban then did what most political representatives will simply not do, he told the truth about multiculturalism."
"Of course, they won't."
They can't even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are.
PM Orban has remained consistent.
Orban's border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99%!
"""They don’t want a 'German life' in Germany in the sense that they are willing to accept German values,"" she added."
DOJ Unseals Indictment Involving Uranium One Scandal
This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
The Department of Justice unsealed an 11-count indictment on Friday to a former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive who stands accused of a bribery and money laundering scheme involving a Russian nuclear official connected to the Uranium One deal.
The indictment corroborates a November report by The Hill that an FBI mole deeply embedded in the Russian uranium industry had gathered extensive evidence of the scheme.
"Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering."
"The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX."
–DOJ
"While the indictment lists Lambert’s company as “Transportation Corporation A,” a simple search reveals that Lambert is the co-President of DAHER-TLI, “the leading front end freight forwarding company dedicated to Nuclear Cargo,” according to its website."
"In 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a letter to Lambert with findings that TLI had exported plutonium “in excess of the maximum quantity and type applied for and licensed,” and “exported Australian obligated material, which was not authorized under license conditions.”"
The indictment against Lambert corroborates prior reporting by The Hill that an FBI mole buried deep within the Russian nuclear industry had gathered extensive evidence of a scheme involving bribes and kickbacks between Russian nuclear officials and TLI – which would have transported the U.S. uranium sold to Russia in the ’20 percent’ Uranium One deal.
"And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.”"
Based on what the FBI knew – including evidence which purportedly includes a video of Russians preparing briefcases of bribe money – the Uranium One deal never should have gone through.
"Moreover, both Robert Mueller and current deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were directly involved – and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department officials appear to be covering for them."
"In short, the FBI had ample evidence of the Russian bribery plot before the Obama administration approved the Uranium One deal thanks to their embedded mole in the Russian nuclear industry."
official and former Chief Counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee Victoria Toensing.
"After Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-VA) demanded Campbell be allowed to testify in front of Congress, the gag order was lifted."
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear transport bribery case, however several congressional republicans pushed back:"
"“Attorney General Sessions seemed to say that the bribery, racketeering and money laundering offenses involving Tenex’s Vadim Mikerin occurred after the approval of the Uranium One deal by the Obama administration."
"But we know that the FBI’s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009,” Rep. Ron DeSantis, (R-Fla.) told The Hill."
“It is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed.
"I hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves,” added DeSantis, whose House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels."
"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a similar rebuke last week to Rosenstein, saying the deputy attorney general’s first response to the committee “largely missed the point” of the congressional investigations."
"“The essential question is whether the Obama Justice Department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the CFIUS approval of the Uranium One deal and other government decisions that enabled the Russians to trade nuclear materials in the U.S,” Grassley scolded.”"
"Meanwhile, journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant’s evidence, while Carter issued an explosive report in late November laying out the players, the timeline, and the evidence at hand."
"“By the time the sale of Uranium One was approved by the Obama Administration, the FBI’s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of Russia’s intentions to enter the U.S. energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in American uranium,” Carter writes."
Highlights:
"FBI mole William Campbell was a highly valued FBI asset – paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a celebration dinner in Chrystal City, VA, where Campbell’s attorney says they thanked him for his service."
"Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money – which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian “nuclear money laundering apparatus”"
"Campbell collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period"
"Campbell uncovered a Russian plot to penetrate the Obama administration and gain approval for the Uranium One sale, including a 2010 email which describes “Russia’s intent on expanding its Uranium expansion in the United States.”"
"“This is not just about bribery and kickbacks but about a U.S. company that was transporting yellow-cake for the Russians with our approval,” an unnamed U.S. Intelligence official told Carter, adding “This should raise serious questions."
"At the time everyone was concerned about Russia’s ties to Iran, we still are."

"“Islamic Converts Ask Pope in Open Letter To Change His Teaching on Islam,” by Steve Skojec, OnePeterFive.com, January 11, 2018:"
"A new, open letter to the pope is making the rounds on the Internet, and it has gathered over 2,600 signatures so far."
"“Most Holy Father,” it begins, “‬Many of us ‬have tried to contact you, ‬on many occasions ‬and for several years, ‬and we have never received the slightest acknowledgement of our letters or requests for meetings.”"
"The letter is not from the dubia cardinals, or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal, or from the signatories of the Filial Correction, but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism, who want Francis to answer a simple question: why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is “a good religion in itself” as the pope “seems to teach”?"
"It’s a question he refuses to answer, despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church."
"The signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer:"
Do not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives?
"Islam prescribes death for apostates (Quran 4.89, 8.7-11), do you know?"
How is it possible to compare Islamic violence with so-called Christian violence?
“What is the relationship between Christ and Satan?
What union is there between light and darkness?
"What association between the faithful and the unfaithful?” (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life."
Are we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam?
"The letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation:"
"In fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything."
"We must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5)."
"Also, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naiveté in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous."
"How can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: “To wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (…) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran."
"“(Rome, January 20, 2014)?"
"That the Pope seems to propose the Quran as a way of salvation, is that not cause for worry?"
Should we return to Islam?
"the welcoming of migrants regardless of the fact that they are Muslims, something forbidden by Apostolic command: “If anyone comes to you but refuses this Gospel, do not receive him among you nor greet him."
"Whoever greets him participates in his evil works.” (2 John 1.10-11); “If anyone preaches to you a different Gospel, let him be accursed!” (Galatians 1.8-9)"

I have lost my diocese.
"You think that all men are equal, but Islam does not say that all men are equal."
"(…) If you do not understand this very quickly, you will become the victims of the enemy that you have invited into your home.” (August 9, 2014) “."
Where then would we go to seek refuge?
The signatories plea is that the pope will “quickly convene a synod on the dangers of Islam.”
We Should Be More Like Sweden: Gov May Use Army Against Immigrant Gangs
Progressives say we should be more like Sweden.
What should we do?
Maybe we should be more like Sweden?
"Sweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday."
"Sweden's murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope."
Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year.
One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm.
"Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants."
Bringing in the military comes in as an option ahead of cutting migration to Sweden.
Maybe because the gangs in question are immigrant gangs.
"The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ($880 million) through 2020, toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails, among other measures."
Sound familiar?
And the gang violence keeps rising.
But who are these gangs?
The criminal gang Loyal to Familia has already spread across Denmark from its base in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen and now it appears to have set its sights on Sweden.
Swedish police told the Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet that the gang is trying to build a presence in both Malmö and Helsingborg.
An expansion into Malmö could be a recipe for increased violence in light of the fact that gun violence claimed the lives of 11 people in the southern Swedish city last year.
"The gang's leader, Shuaib Khan, confirmed that the group is eyeing the two Swedish cities but denied that Loyal to Familia was a “criminal gang”."
Just one of those Danish gangs led by a fellow named Khan.

"Congressman: ""Credible Evidence"" Of “Terrorist Infiltration Through the Southern Border” Related To Las Vegas Shooting"
"We have had the Islamic State claim over and over that they were taking credit for the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017, and that Stephen Paddock was a recent convert to Islam."
"If you recall, the Islamic State has never claimed responsibility for attacks they were not involved in."
Here are just a few of those claims.
"In Naba 100 #ISIS featured an infographic on #LasVegas attack & indicated the shooter, ""Abu Abdul Barr al-Amriki,"" converted 6 months ago pic.twitter.com/5JhMFbU2Se — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) October 5, 2017"
"On Thursday evening, Representative Scott Perry (R-PA) appeared on Tucker Carlson tonight and said that he has evidence that the Islamic State may be telling the truth and that they may actually have been involved in the deadly attack."
"Perry brought up the fact that we can't seem to get information in the case that the public needs to be made aware of, something that was brought up in a district courtroom earlier this week."
"Additionally, the family of Stephen Paddock just received his cremated remains on Thursday and his brother said that the family has yet to receive an autopsy report."
Why is that?
Everyone who was killed that night had autopsies and those have been released.
"We're told Paddock shot himself in the head, right?"
"""Twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States they would attack Las Vegas,"" he added."
"""In June and August."""
"""And then after the attack claimed responsibility four times,"" Perry continued."
"""I’m just telling you I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus,"" Perry said."
"The investigation has been conducted by local and state police, not the feds, and yet, they continue to claim there is not Islamic terrorist involvement."
"Yet, though they claim that Paddock was a lone gunman, they continue to withhold video of him in Mandalay Bay because they are still investigating other suspects to charge in the shooting."
And no one seems to know where alleged Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos is either.
None of this is really that surprising.
"If you recall, we reported on Islamic terrorists settling into Mexico and crossing the border some years back and that came out as the infamous ""Gang of Eight"" were working on an immigration deal and had rejected building the 700 miles of double-tier border fencing Congress authorized just seven years ago, with a majority of the Senate saying they didn't want to delay granting illegal immigrants legal status while the fence was being built."
"Three years prior to that report, there was a video report that seems to have provided a bit of evidence to the claim that Islamists were crossing our southern border."
"In fact, DHS had denied Muslim terrorists were crossing the border, but a local investigator produced evidence to the contrary."
"Reports indicated that some jihadis were paying as much as $50,000 to get across the border."
This has been documented for several years now.
It's not surprising.

Americans still have no idea what happened in Las Vegas in October.
"During an appearance with Tucker Carlson on Fox, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said he’s seen credible evidence that ISIS was involved in the devastating Las Vegas shooting."
"ISIS terrorists, he said, infiltrated the U.S. via the southern border prior to the attack blamed on alleged lone gunman Stephen Paddock."
"“Recently I have been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence, credible information regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident,” Perry said."
Perry added that ISIS warnings of a forthcoming attack on Las Vegas prior to the shooting make a terror link even more likely.
"“Well, they could be–lets face it, ISIS twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States that they would attack Las Vegas in June and August after the attack claimed responsibility four times."
"An incredulous Carlson asked fellow guest Catherine Lombardo, a lawyer representing families affected by the tragedy, about the law enforcement investigation into the shooting."
"“The FBI and the Las Vegas metro police department have been conducting the investigation, ” she said."
"“We’ve seen no evidence of a terrorist attack, and I will ask with all due respect, congressman, unless have you specific evidence to back that up, it seems a bit irresponsible to make that allegation so, if you do, or make that assertion, if do you have any evidence of that, I’m asking you right now to share it with us and tell us what that is."
"“We’ve all been waiting, and I’m waiting, too."
"Like I said, nothing adds up, but I’m just telling you, I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus, and we’re gonna have to wait… until the situation develops,” he said."
The lawmaker said he wants the nation’s counterterror agencies involved in the investigation.
The Pope Is Now Openly Attacking Child Sexual Abuse Victims For “Slander”
"That’s right, Pope Francis ended his trip by publicly defending a bishop who victims have accused of covering up widespread pedophilia in the country."
Fernando Karadima who has been found guilty of sexually abusing a slew of minors as a member of the Catholic Church.
"Pope Francis accused victims of Chile’s most notorious pedophile of slander Thursday, an astonishing end to a visit meant to help heal the wounds of a sex abuse scandal that has cost the Catholic Church its credibility in the country."
Francis said that until he sees proof that Bishop Juan Barros was complicit in covering up the sex crimes of the Rev.
They noted the accusers were deemed credible enough by the Vatican that it sentenced Karadima to a lifetime of “penance and prayer” for his crimes in 2011.
"A Chilean judge also found the victims to be credible, saying that while she had to drop criminal charges against Karadima because too much time had passed, proof of his crimes wasn’t lacking."
[…] The Karadima scandal dominated Francis’ visit to Chile and the overall issue of sex abuse and church cover-up was likely to factor into his three-day trip to Peru that began late Thursday.
Only when the victims went public with their accusations in 2010 did the Vatican launch an investigation that led to Karadima being removed from ministry.
The emeritus archbishop of Santiago subsequently apologized for having refused to believe the victims from the start.
One of the victims made clear his disgust at Pope Francis for essentially covering up for a man who watched as another bishop sexually abused him.
"“As if I could have taken a selfie or a photo while Karadima abused me and others and Juan Barros stood by watching it all,” tweeted Juan Carlos Cruz."
"Nothing has changed, and his plea for forgiveness is empty.”"
This obviously does not look good for the Pope or the Catholic Church as they are now apparently engaging in attacking the victims instead of actually going after the abusers.
PROOF: The LVMPD And FBI Failed To Catalog At Least One Deceased Las Vegas Massacre Victim As Death Toll Rises
LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) — The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have failed to catalogue at least one deceased victim of the 1 October massacre which reportedly only left 58 people dead.
The woman’s lifeless body can be seen being drug across the parking lot by several men who placed the body behind a pick-up truck while the gunfire continued.
"The event was reported by Intellihub’s Shepard Ambellas on Nov. 11, 2017, in the article titled Private surveillance footage reveals “helicopter hovering overhead” at time of Las Vegas Massacre, FBI never asked for tape, after an excerpt of the footage aired on Tucker Carlson Tonight."
"At 10:16 p.m., two men drag a “fallen victim” across the parking lot."
"The men position the victim behind a Ford pickup truck, presumably to shield themselves and the victim from taking any further incoming rounds as they attempted to give the victim medical assistance."
"“Later at ten-twenty-four p.m., one of the men places his shirt across the victim’s face and then at ten-thirty-two a man places what appears to be a blanket or towel over the body after they had given up hope,” Tucker Carlson said."
“Police only arrive in this area for the first time around ten-forty-five p.m. when the body is still there.” The victim’s body was eventually was loaded into the back of a Ford Raptor pickup truck at 11:50 p.m. and taken away.
"Astonishingly, between the times of 10:13 p.m. and 10:16 p.m. a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera which Carlson claims is from a “helicopter hovering overhead.” A quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen."
"However, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer."
"In fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead."
"However, the official report failed to catalogue the dead woman who was shot in the parking lot of a Haven Street business."
The following image is taken from page 34 of the LVMPD preliminary report which shows the seven victims and their locations of death numbered in yellow.
The next photo shows where the unnamed victim was located.
The victim can be seen being dragged in the following video.
"The following day, several men, one of which presumably was Fox News anchor Sean Hannity (who was heavily guarded by a five-man security team), received mobile haircuts in the very same parking lot, in nearly the same spot the victim’s body was dragged to."
Who was this victim?
“Credible Evidence Of A Terrorist Infiltration”: Congressman Says ‘Secret Intel’ Proves ISIS Connection To Las Vegas Massacre
"Appearing on Fox News Tucker Carlson Tonight, Perry described evidence he had personally seen that suggested that some sort of terrorist infiltration aided the Las Vegas Massacre."
"“Recently, I have been made aware of what i believe to be credible evidence, credible information, regarding potential terrorist infiltration, through the southern border, regarding this event,” Perry shockingly claimed."
Keep in mind that this lines up with other alternative media reports regarding the Oct. 1st massacre as well as hints provided in the mainstream media.
"We also know that it is a conclusive fact that there was more than one shooter, according to literally dozens of eyewitnesses who have continued to come forward with what they saw that fateful night."

London Borough With Highest Percentage Of Muslims In UK Votes To Ban Trump From Entering
"Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain."
One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
"Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country."
"“London: Muslim Enclave Votes to ‘Ban Trump,’” by Liam Deacon, Breitbart, January 20, 2018:"
"The council has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups and wielding “undue spiritual influence” on Muslim voters."
"The anti-Trump motion, proposed by Councillor Ohid Ahmed and Councillor Oliur Rahman, passed by a majority vote this week."
"It calls for President Trump’s planned state visit to the United Kingdom to be cancelled, adding: “Should the Government still choose to go ahead with State Visit, this Council makes clear that President Trump would not be welcome in our Borough.” The area in East London includes the famous Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf, but the ban does not appear to be enforceable."
"For the record, our group refused to vote in this farce.” “Tower Hamlets is home to one of the country’s most diverse communities,” the motion begins, adding that it “has the highest percentage of Muslim residents in England – 35 per cent compared with the national average of 5 per cent”."

Arizona Border Patrol Nabs Armed Mexican National Attempting To Take Stolen Truck Into Mexico
"TUCSON, Ariz. –U.S."
Customs and Border Protection officers at Arizona’s Port of Nogales stopped an armed Mexican national from taking a stolen truck into Mexico on Tuesday.
Officers working outbound operations at the Dennis DeConcini Crossing yesterday afternoon referred a 23-year-old legal permanent resident alien male for further inspection of the Ford F350 truck he was driving before he could go into Mexico.
"A records check confirmed the truck had been stolen, leading officers to place the subject under arrest."
"Officers seized a 9MM handgun the subject was carrying, and further search of his belongings uncovered a loaded magazine and additional ammunition."
"They also found trace amounts of marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, and drug paraphernalia."
"Officers arrested the subject, and turned him over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations."
"Officers seized the drugs, weapon, and ammunition."
The stolen truck has been turned over to the Arizona Regional Auto Theft Task Force.
SPECIAL REPORT: Pope Francis Accused of Inaction in Notorious Sex Abuse Cases
There is not a single piece of evidence against him.
It is all calumny.
Is that clear?”
"Writing for the Boston Globe, the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001, Kevin Cullen wrote, “Let the record show that the promise of Pope Francis died in Santiago, Chile, on Jan. 18, in the year of our Lord 2018… he has revealed himself like no one else could.”"
But it gets worse than this.
"Though he’s “sticking with Francis” for now, Winters wrote, “I wish I knew what it was about Pope Francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with Bishop Barros, the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church."
"On January 23rd, an unsigned NCR editorial opined, “Within the space of four days, Pope Francis twice slandered abuse survivors.”"
“These remarks are at the least shameful.
"At the most, they suggest that Francis now could be complicit in the cover-up."
"The script is all too familiar: Discredit the survivors’ testimony, support the prelate in question, and bank on public attention moving on to something else."
Three separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him.
The second journalist to ask Francis about Barros on the flight was a Chilean woman.
She asked: ‘Why are not the victims’ testimonies proof for you?
"Why do you not believe them?’ The pope gave no satisfying answer, only repeating a claim of ‘no evidence’ against the bishop.”"
"Indeed, it was understood, as the Washington Post said, that Francis’ trip to Latin America – dogged by protests over Barros both in person at the pope’s appearances and in the press – was in part intended as “an apology tour” to abuse survivors."
Which is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to Bergoglio’s ability to turn on a dime.
All was going as planned.
"On Wednesday, January 17, the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests."
"He made all the right noises, talking about his “pain and shame,” and reportedly even crying, at what happened."
24 hours later he was calling them liars.
"James Hamilton, 49 and now a doctor, was one of the Barros accusers."
"He told the BBC at a press conference, “What the Pope has done today is offensive and painful, and not only against us, but against everyone seeking to end the abuses.” The lead voice of the victims in Chile, Juan Carlos Cruz, tweeting to one of Francis’s leading apologists, Austen Ivereigh, said, “Does he need a photo, a selfie, as proof?"
"Sorry Austen, we didn’t think of it as we were being abused and Juan Barros watching.”"
"Although the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip, the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern Chilean diocese of Osorno in 2015."
Barros claimed in court that the first he knew of Karadima’s offenses was on a Chilean television programme in 2010.
This is refuted by Karadima’s victims – deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal – who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago.
"Last Thursday, however, was not the first time Francis, confronted unexpectedly in public over the Barros question, has responded testily and with insults."
"In 2015 the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in St. Peter’s Piazza, asking that he reconsider the appointment, citing the “suffering” of the Church in Chile over the issue."
The insults were not forgotten.
"The jab certainly wasn’t lost on Francis, since the signs were being held by protesters the full length of his auto route to Santiago from the airport."
"One of the protesters told the BBC, “He doesn’t even know us, so how can he accuse us of being such things?"
He thinks we are politically motivated even though we come from different parishes in Osorno and are doing this because we are against priests being allowed to abuse children.”
"This also followed an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by Sean Cardinal O’Malley – a member of the C9 council of cardinals and the former head of the pope’s sex abuse commission – who said, “It is understandable that Pope Francis’ statements yesterday in Santiago, Chile were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator.”"
"Of course, Francis being Francis the apology was banked around with assertions of how right he was."
"“I have to ask forgiveness because the word ‘proof’ wounded,” he said."
"“It wounded many people who were abused…I ask them for forgiveness because I wounded them without realizing it, but it was an unintended wound."
"“And I know how much they suffer, to feel that the Pope says in their face ‘bring me a letter, a proof.’ It’s a slap."
"And I agree that my expression was not apt, because I didn’t think.”"
"He doubled down, saying, “I have not heard any victim of Barros."
"They did not come, they did not show themselves, they did not give evidence in court."
It is true that Barros was in Karadima’s group of young people.
"But let us be clear: if you accuse someone without evidence with pertinacity, that is calumny.”"
“This is what I can say with sincerity.
Barros will remain there if I don’t find a way to condemn him.
I cannot condemn him if I don’t have – I don’t say proof – but evidence.
And there are many ways to get evidence.
Is that clear?”
This “contrite” papal apology didn’t fly well even with the regular news reporters.
"Indeed, Francis claim that he met with and heard the “pain” of the victims is untrue in the specific case in hand."
CBS News reports that though the Osorno group had tried to obtain a meeting during the trip they were refused.
"Greg Burke, the pope’s press officer, confirmed that “no papal meetings were planned with the Osorno group, which had formally requested to meet with the pope in July but were told by Vatican organizers that his schedule was already final, some six months before the trip.”"
Who is Barros?
Some may remember a video that made the internet rounds of an uproar in a Chilean cathedral at the installation ceremony of a bishop.
At the time it didn’t draw much attention from the English language press – mostly at that time distracted by the ongoing battle of the notorious Kasper Proposal and the oncoming Synods.
"But despite the pope’s claim, the charges against Barros are serious and have been deemed credible by a judge."
"He is accused of having covered up sexual abuse, including destroying evidence, committed by Karadima in the ‘80s and ‘90s."
"In fact – and this point has tended to get glossed over in the press – Barros is accused by the victims of having been in the room, watching at the time, and of engaging in sexual activity with Karadima."
"Juan Carlos Cruz, told the press in 2015 that he and another boy – both in their teens at the time – “would lie down on the priest’s [Karadima’s] bed, one resting his head at the man’s shoulder, another sitting near his feet."
"The priest would kiss the boys and grope them, he said, all while the Rev."
"Juan Barros watched.” Cruz, now a 51-year-old “gay” journalist, told The Associated Press, “Barros was there, and he saw it all.”"
Things are a bit different now.
Neither was the complaint against Barros without the support of responsible people.
"The media reported that over 1,300 Catholic faithful in Osorno, including 30 priests of the diocese and 51 members of Parliament, wrote to the pope asking him to rescind the appointment – none of which received any response."
Fr.
"Peter Kleigel, a priest of Osorno, told Associated Press, “We’re convinced that this appointment is not correct because, following canon law, a bishop must be well-regarded."
We need a bishop who’s credible.”
"The problem with getting the news out about Karadima, as in most of these cases, was the bishop, in this case Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz of Santiago, who after the Conclave of 2013 was appointed a member of Pope Francis’s C9 inner council."
"Allegations against Karadima – that went back to 1962 – had certainly been reported to Church authorities well before a Chilean news agency revealed the case in 2010, but were ignored by Errázuriz."
"Even the National Catholic Reporter in 2014 pointed to the cover up and the relationship between the new pope and the accused cardinals,"
"“Hamilton had applied for a marriage annulment, after telling his wife of a long psychosexual entanglement with Karadima that began when he was 17 in El Bosque."
"His wife confided in a priest, who told Errázuriz in 2006."
"When a canon lawyer and several priests close to the cardinal suggested that Hamilton not mention Karadima, he pressed on with his request in order to force the issue of punishment for the priest while having his marriage annulled."
"Again, Errázuriz refused to take action against Karadima.”"
The pope’s claim that there is “no evidence” flies in the face of the ruling of the civil judge in the Karadima case – a fact that ought to be of paramount consideration under the Vatican’s own rules for determining credibility in such cases.
"While Judge Jessica Gonzalez was forced to drop criminal charges because the statute of limitations had expired, she affirmed that testimony by Cruz and other victims was credible."
"After a full year of investigation, Gonzalez called their claims “truthful and reliable”."
"Victims said that a letter written to Church authorities complaining of Karadima’s abuse in 1982 was intercepted and destroyed by Barros, who was serving at the time as secretary to Cardinal Francisco Fresno, Errázuriz’s successor and collaborator."
"As for Barros’s general credibility as a Catholic bishop, the witness of the victims is damning."
"In a letter to Bishop Ivo Scapolo, papal nuncio to Chile, that Cruz gave to the Associated Press, he said he witnessed Karadima and Barros in an intimate relationship."
“I saw Karadima and Juan Barros kissing and touching each other.
The groping generally came from Karadima touching Barros’ genitals”.
Barros has never denied having had a close friendship with Karadima.
"Hamilton confirmed this saying, “I saw how Barros watched it all.”"
And the matter didn’t end in 2010.
Which brings us to Francis Bergoglio’s own record in this area.
"The pope claimed “I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes,” but this claim is not supported by the reality."
"Indeed, it has been pointed out that Francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor at “safeguarding” young people, punishing abusers and removing bishops who cover it up."
"In the case of Barros, the Associated Press obtained a confidential letter from Pope Francis dated 2015 that “reveals the [Chilean] bishops’ concern about Francis naming a Karadima protégé, Bishop Juan Barros.” Just days before the pope’s “calumny” comment, January 11, AP reported that Francis had full knowledge of the controversy he risked in appointing Barros to Osorno."
“[H]is ambassador in Chile had tried to find a way to contain the damage well before the case made headlines.”
"The letter, addressed to the executive committee of the Chilean bishops’ conference, said, “Thank you for having openly demonstrated the concern that you have about the appointment of Monsignor Juan Barros."
"I understand what you’re telling me and I’m aware that the situation of the church in Chile is difficult due to the trials you’ve had to undergo.” The letter said that in 2014 the nuncio, Archbishop Scapolo, had asked Barros to resign as bishop of the armed forces and had “encouraged him to take a sabbatical year before assuming any other pastoral responsibility as a bishop.”"
There can also be little doubt the new pope was fully aware of the record of his close friend Cardinal Errázuriz in ignoring complaints of Karadima’s victims when he appointed him to the C9 council.
"And even if he didn’t then, he certainly knows now, and yet Errazuriz continues in that advisory role."
"Francis further appointed Cardinal Errázuriz to serve as his Special Envoy to World Apostolic Congress Of Mercy III meeting in Bogotá, Colombia in June 2014."
"Since 2001, Cardinal Ratzinger and later as Pope Benedict installed effective procedural reforms on clerical sexual abuse; Francis in his short five years has all but completely dismantled or reversed those changes."
Danneels’s prominence in the Bergoglian pontificate continues to be the most prominent indicator of the pope’s deprioritising of clerical sexual abuse.
"At the end of a long career as Europe’s leading “liberal” Catholic prelate, Danneels came under a cloud of scandal when he was accused of having covered for a protégé bishop who admitted to having sexually abused his own minor nephew."
In 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon-to-retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges.
The cardinal even went so far as to suggest that the victim should “ask forgiveness” for his own role in the scandal.
"Before the recordings were released, Danneels had also denied all knowledge of sexual abuse by clergy or cover-ups."
"Maciel Degollado, founder of the Legionaries of Christ."
"Crucially, it was Ratzinger who moved the competence for sex abuse cases from the Congregation for Bishops to Doctrine of the Faith, with powers to suspend and punish offenders."
His reforms specifically included bishops who had refused to act against priest-abusers.
"A senior member of the Vatican’s diplomatic corps, Archbishop Miguel Maury Buendia, confirmed this, saying, “This Pope has removed two or three bishops per month throughout the world..."
"There have been two or three instances in which they said no, and so the Pope simply removed them.”"
These reforms – and removals – have ceased entirely under Francis.
Inzoli was found guilty in 2012 by an ecclesiastical court of abusing boys as young as twelve and suspended.
"Following an appeal by Coccopalmerio, Francis reduced the priest’s penalty to a “lifetime of prayer,” with permission to say Mass privately, and a promise to stay away from children."
"The uproar over this caused the Italian prosecutors to reopen the case against the priest, and eventually Inzoli went to prison and was laicized."
"As for Ratzinger/Benedict’s procedural reforms, rumours continue to circulate that the pope intends to reverse them as well, placing competence back into the hands of the same dicastery that held it when the scandals broke in 2001."
"A tribunal of bishops, requested by his own sex abuse commission, was ignored and then Francis summarily removed two of the CDF staffers in charge of handling such cases, famously refusing to give any reasons to CDF prefect Cardinal Müller who was soon to be dismissed."
"Marie Collins, an Irish abuse survivor, was appointed in 2014 to the new Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors."
"She resigned in 2017, citing “Vatican officials’ reluctance to cooperate with its work to protect children.” Collins released a damning statement, indicating that the commission had never seriously intended to change or reform anything."
She said none of the commission’s recommendations had been implemented.
"As of December last year, the commission has been allowed to lapse, and no longer functions, though it has not been definitively dissolved."
The terms of office of its members expired December 17th.
This week Collins tweeted her question for Pope Francis on the Chilean situation: “Why does the Pope not believe these three men?
They have been consistent over years in what they say.
When asked why he believes his fellow cleric and not the survivors he can give no good reason.”
Why indeed.
Man who sold ammo to Las Vegas gunman speaks out
© Provided by CBS Interactive Inc. Douglas Haig
New documents reveal the name of the second person of interest in the Las Vegas shooting.
"Police believe Douglas Haig may have conspired with gunman Stephen Paddock, but it's unclear if he's still under investigation."
Haig sold Paddock ammunition the month before the October attack that killed 58 people dead and wounded hundreds of others.
"Mandalay Bay hotel staff had numerous run-ins with Vegas gunman: companyLas Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock had lost money, been depressed, sheriff says"
"Haig was contacted one day after the attack, after investigators found an Amazon box with his address on it inside Paddock's hotel room, reports CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal."
But Haig says he had no idea what Paddock was planning to do when he met him just a few weeks before the massacre.
Haig says he sold Paddock 720 rounds of ammunition from Haig's home gun business.
"""I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,"" he said."
"""He told me exactly what he wanted."
"I handed him a box with the ammunition in it, and he paid me and he left."""
"The rounds he sold are called ""tracer ammunition"" – bullets that leave a visible trail when fired."
"""He said he was going to go put on a light show."
"And I can't remember whether he said for or with his friends, but that's what he did say,"" Haig said."
"But newly released search warrant records filed last fall by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department say Haig ""may have conspired with Stephen Paddock to commit murder with a deadly weapon."""
Haig strongly denies that.
"""I felt that they were hoping that they could find a connection between myself and Paddock, that would go back showing that I supplied him with most of his ammunition, possibly even some firearms,"" Haig said."
"""They're not gonna find it."
"I talked to the guy three times."""
"It's unclear whether Haig is still a person of interest, but he was the only one mentioned by name in the search warrant, other than Marilou Danley - Paddock's girlfriend."
Authorities have since said they don't plan to bring charges against Danley.
Las Vegas gunman's motive still unknown
"Haig does not blame himself, but within weeks of the massacre, he still decided to shut down his business."
"Why didn't I pick this up?"""
he said.
"Haig, represented by his Phoenix attorneys Marc Victor and Andrew Marcantel, has not been charged."
His attorneys say he continues to cooperate with investigators.
"CBS News reached out to the FBI and other authorities involved, but none will comment on an active investigation."
Lawyer: Ammo dealer saw nothing suspicious in Vegas gunman
"Douglas Haig had no reason to believe Stephen Paddock would launch the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people, attorney Marc Victor said."
He said Haig wishes he could have figured out the intentions of Paddock but defends the sale of ammunition as legal.
"""He wishes there was some clue that could have identified him,"" Victor said."
"""There was just nothing."""
"Meanwhile, the coroner in Las Vegas started releasing redacted autopsy records about the 58 people killed in the mass shooting at an outdoor concert."
Records relating to Paddock were not being provided.
The records were released Wednesday in response to a public records lawsuit filed by The Associated Press and Las Vegas Review-Journal.
"Haig was named as a ""person of interest"" in the investigation by mistake Tuesday when court documents were released nearly four months after the shooting."
"The documents did not disclose why authorities considered Haig a person of interest, and officials haven't said whether he has since been cleared of that designation."
Victor said his client sold ammunition to Paddock once and doesn't believe they have communicated since.
"Las Vegas police and officials with the FBI, U.S. attorney's office in Nevada and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives each declined Wednesday to comment about Haig or the investigation."
"A law enforcement official told The Associated Press in October that Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of tracer ammunition from a private seller he met at a Phoenix gun show three weeks before the shooting."
The official spoke anonymously because they weren't authorized to disclose case information.
Tracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct.
Haig told the AP on Tuesday that he sold unspecified ammunition to Paddock.
"He also told ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday that he sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Paddock."
"""I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,"" he said of Paddock."
"The ammunition sale took place at Haig's home in Mesa, because he didn't have all the ammunition on hand that Paddock wanted while at the gun show."
Victor said a box that Paddock used to carry ammunition out of Haig's house and bore his client's name was later found in the Las Vegas hotel where the attack was launched.
It's unknown whether the ammunition Haig sold to Paddock was used in the attack.
The lawyer said the type and quantity of ammunition Paddock bought from his client wasn't unusual.
"Robert Spitzer, an expert on firearms and the Second Amendment, said by and large there are no restrictions on the amount of ammunition a person can buy, but a large sale of tracer ammunition would certainly be unusual."
Only six states in the U.S. have laws requiring that ammunition buyers pass a background check.
"Arizona and Nevada do not have such a requirement, nor do they mandate that dealers keep a record of ammunition transactions."
"""If you are in the business of selling anything, you are usually happy to make the sale, and there's nothing that says you need to write down this person's name or report the sale,"" said Spitzer, who is the chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland."
"Victor said his client has cooperated with investigators who contacted him within 24 hours of the shooting and has spoken to them probably four or five times, though he hasn't talked to them in months."
Haig describes himself as a senior engineer for Honeywell Aerospace in his biography on the professional and social media platform LinkedIn.
Records show Haig also owns Specialized Military Ammunition LLC.
"The company's website says it sold tracer and incendiary ammunition but is now ""closed indefinitely."""
"Haig's name was blacked out in the more than 270 pages of search warrant records released by a Nevada judge to the AP, but remained on one page of documents provided to the Las Vegas Review-Journal."
The newspaper published the name online.
"Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish later ordered the full document not be published without redactions, but she acknowledged she couldn't order the newspaper to retract the name."
Haig plans to hold a news conference Friday to discuss his interaction with Paddock.
Garcia Cano reported from Las Vegas.

India Joins U.S. and China With Plans to Visit the Moon
"So far, no one has ever managed to land on the far side of the moon, or near its shadowy poles."
"The mission is scheduled to launch sometime in the first half of this year, no earlier than March."
"Its target is a patch of lunar surface about 370 miles away from the south pole, where scientists think the rock may be 4 billion years old, formed just after the moon's giant ocean of liquid rock began to solidify."
"The region is an area NASA would also like to visit, preferably with a robot that would bring souvenir rock home to Earth for scientists to analyze directly in the laboratory."
"But despite NASA's renewed focus on lunar exploration, as dictated in December by an order from President Trump, the agency won't beat India back to the moon."

That's even after India's Chandrayaan-2 mission was delayed by three years after Russia backed out of designing and producing the mission's lander.
"Rather than lose out on that part of the mission, the Indian Space Research Organization decided to just do it themselves."
"But they aren't sure how long they can expect the mission to last once the lander and rover arrive—it could be over in as little as two weeks, ending as soon as the sun sets, since the mission runs on solar power and the polar area is quite shadowy even during the day."
"During that time, the team hopes to gather data about charged particles around the moon and the small ""moonquakes"" that ripple through its surface."

"The new mission's predecessor, Chandrayaan-1, was an orbiter that found the first evidence that there was water ice on the moon."
"Now, scientists know that ice is likely concentrated at the poles, where it could become an important resource for human and robotic explorers alike."
The orbiter piece of the upcoming mission will look to build on its predecessor by mapping how water actually moves around the moon.
"In the long term, India has its sights set well beyond the moon, with dreams of visiting Mars, Venus or an asteroid."
Coroner Defies Court Order: Won't Release Las Vegas Shooter's Autopsy Report
Clark County Nevada Coroner John Fudenberg has determined to defy a court order from a district court judge to release the autopsy report of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock.
"Though the order was issued on Tuesday, Fudenberg conferred with others and seems determined to not release the autopsy report until, as he said, it is ""finalized,"" The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, which sued for the autopsy report."
The body has been cremated!
"“I don’t believe this is consistent with what the court ordered,” said Las Vegas attorney Maggie McLetchie, who represents the Las Vegas Review-Journal and The Associated Press in their November action demanding the release of the reports."
"“They (the coroner’s office) have delayed this for too long, and whatever stage the coroner’s report on Paddock is in, it should be provided to the Review-Journal and Associated Press without further delay."
Release the records.”
"“The court correctly recognized the presumption of public access to records, even when a mass tragedy occurs,” McLetchie added."
"“(The judge) also rejected arguments by the coroner’s office that there were any privacy interests with regards to the autopsy of Stephen Paddock, let alone any that outweighed the strong presumption of access to records in Nevada.”"
"“The shooter’s body was cremated Dec. 21,"" said Review-Journal Editor-in-Chief Keith Moyer added."
The law is squarely on the side of the public’s right to open government.”
"McLetchie has been trying to obtain as much information for the public as possible, including video of Paddock at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino."
"However, she has been told by Las Vegas Metro Police Department attornies that they can't release that information until they finalize their investigation into other suspects which may also produce charges in the case."
"“The coroner’s office has fought to keep autopsy reports confidential,” the Review-Journal."
"The coroner was ordered on January 11 to pay nearly $32,000 in legal costs to the Review-Journal because it refused to release public records."
"While the preliminary report indicated the Paddock died of a gun shot wound to the head through the mouth, it's all the details that aren't given that seem to be problematic for the coroner to release."
Article posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media
It appears that a further cover-up is underway in regards to the 1 October massacre in which 58 people were killed
"LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) — The Coroner finally released the autopsy for the 58 victims but not for the alleged shooter Stephen Paddock after a judge ruled that the coroner release all the documents and pay $32,000 in legal fees."
"This, despite the fact that the report does state that recovered bullet fragments were turned over to the police."
"Moreover, against public law, the coroner has still not released the autopsy report for “Stephen Paddock” after an Intellihub article definitively proved the body recovered in Mandalay Bay room 32-135 was not Paddock’s."
"In fact, the coroner claims that he still has to “finalize” the report despite the fact the autopsy was conducted."
Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge
"(CNN) Douglas Haig, an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law."
A criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop.
"The bullets in the cartridges were armor-piercing, with an incendiary capsule in the nose, the complaint says."
"The FBI on October 19 searched Haig's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor-piercing, the complaint said."
"Haig did not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, documents said."
"Police say Paddock, 64, opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd-floor room at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival, killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others."
More than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack.
Investigators say Paddock died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Douglas Haig's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records.
"Haig, 55, appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings."
He is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing.
"The maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine."
"Haig's attorney, Marc J. Victor, told CNN he had no comment."
"CNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court, and the lawyer said he couldn't say anything because of the ongoing case."
"""My first obligation and only obligation is to my client,"" he told KNXV."
The complaint
Haig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest
"In a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show."
"Tracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going."
Haig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing.
"Victor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock ""was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs."""
"But in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August."
It's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show.
The complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig.

"Two law enforcement sources told CNN in October that Paddock, during the massacre, fired incendiary bullets at a 43,000-barrel fuel tank on the grounds of nearby McCarran International Airport in what investigators believe was a failed attempt to cause an explosion."
"Victor, his attorney, declined to comment about CNN's questions about the incendiary rounds."
The complaint does not name Haig's associate.
The law enforcement sources also said tracer rounds were found in Paddock's hotel room.
"But there was no evidence the tracer rounds were used during the attack, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about such details."
Authorities have repeatedly said Paddock was the only shooter.
Friday's charges do not allege that Haig knew of Paddock's intentions to kill in Las Vegas.
Haig says he saw nothing suspicious
"Haig, an aerospace engineer and part-time ammunition reseller, said at Friday's news conference that he never saw anything suspicious in his brief interactions with Paddock."
"Paddock arrived at the seller's home in Mesa ""very well-dressed, very well-groomed, very polite, very respectful,"" Haig said."
"""At no time did I see anything suspicious or odd or any kind of a tell, anything that would set off an alarm,"" he said."
Haig also said that he received death threats after his name was revealed this week.
"He stressed that his sale made ""no contribution"" to the killings since Paddock didn't appear to have fired tracer rounds."
"""I hope today ends (the death threats) when people realize that I wasn't in collusion with Paddock -- that I was not in any way, shape or form associated with the horrible crime that he committed,"" Haig said."
Timeline of sales
Haig said he sold 720 rounds of surplus US military tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after Paddock approached him or an associate at gun shows.
JUST WATCHED Man who sold Vegas shooter ammo speaks out Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Man who sold Vegas shooter ammo speaks out 01:00
"He held Friday's news conference to protect his reputation, he and his attorney said."
They gave the following timeline:
• Paddock first approached Haig's table at a Las Vegas gun show sometime last year but met another person who was behind the table.
"• Haig first met Paddock at a subsequent Phoenix gun show, where he was selling ammunition."
• Paddock took Haig's business card because the seller didn't have the quantity of trace ammunition that he wanted.
• Paddock later called Haig three times to arrange a sale at Haig's home.
"• In September, Paddock arrived at Haig's home, bought the tracer ammunition and drove away."
"The ammunition, he said, was:"
"• 600 rounds of 7.62mm NATO, M62, tracer ammunition, manufactured by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri."
"• 120 rounds of 5.56mm M196 tracer ammunition, manufactured by the same plant."
He said the 5.56mm rounds were in their original packaging.
He did not comment on the 7.62mm rounds' packaging.
"Before the sale, Paddock told him ""that he was going to go out to the desert and put on a light show"" with the ammunition -- that he was ""going to go out and shoot it at night with friends."""
Seller's reaction to massacre: 'Revulsion'
Victor said police found his client's name and address on a box that Paddock had -- a box that Haig gave him to carry the tracer rounds he had bought.
Haig said he learned of the massacre when authorities contacted him at work the next morning.
"""Revulsion,"" Haig said of his reaction."
"Haig spoke with investigators four times after the shooting, and has been ""fully cooperative,"" Victor said."
"""This was a routine transaction to purchase a routine type of ammunition that is available in many different retail outlets throughout the state of Arizona,"" Victor said."
"""After that transaction, Doug had absolutely no further contact with Mr."
"Paddock."""
Death threats
Haig said he's received death threats since the search warrant documents were released Tuesday.
"""It's been not a lot of fun, quite frankly."""
"Haig added, ""I had no contribution to what Paddock did."
Haig named as person of interest
A Nevada judge on Tuesday unsealed police search warrant records -- prepared shortly after the shooting -- that mentioned two persons of interest in the case.
The judge released the documents after CNN and other media outlets sued to obtain them.
"One person of interest, whom police had named previously, was the killer's girlfriend, Marilou Danley."
Authorities subsequently cleared her publicly.
The second name was redacted.
"But the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported it had a version of the search warrant that named, without redaction, Haig as that second person."
The documents didn't explain why he was a person of interest.
"Las Vegas police officials told CNN the department couldn't comment on Haig or any names, and referred questions to federal authorities."
Sheriff has said feds were investigating someone
"When the search warrant documents were released this week, Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish allowed a small portion of those records to be redacted because ""there is an ongoing investigation regarding charges against another individual, arising out of information obtained in connection with the ... shooting, but not directly related to the shooting."""
"In response to a question from CNN in January, the Clark County sheriff, Joe Lombardo, said federal authorities are investigating a person in the case."
"That person could face federal charges not directly related to the shooting within the next 60 days, the sheriff said January 19."
"Lombardo didn't disclose the person's name, saying those details were ""under federal grand jury disclosure"" rules."
"On Friday morning, before his arrest, Haig answered a reporter's question about whether he believed he was that person."
"""No."
"I don't think it's me at all,"" Haig said."
Swiss bishop signs statement calling Pope’s reading of Amoris Laetitia “alien” to the Catholic Faith
"NewsCatholic Church, Family, Marriage"
"ROME, February 2, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) —His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur in Switzerland, today added his name to the “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage,” bringing the total number of signatories to eight bishops and one cardinal, LifeSite has confirmed."
"Bishop Eleganti’s support of the profession comes just three days after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world’s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage."
Raising a Common Voice
"The Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage was issued by three Kazakh Ordinaries, including Bishop Schneider, in early January."
"In the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church’s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are divorced and “remarried” may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion."
"They presented their profession “before God who will judge us,” in response to certain pastoral norms issued by several bishops’ conferences aimed at implementing chapter 8 of Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation on the family, Amoris Laetitia."
"“Our conscience as bishops calls to us to do this,” Schneider explained."
"“We were forced by our conscience, in the conscience of the Successors of the Apostles and colleagues of the Pope.”"
Bishop Marian Eleganti
"The profession’s most recent signatory, Bishop Marian Eleganti, O.S.B., is a monk of the abbey of the Missionary Benedictines in St. Otmarsberg in Uznach, located in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland."
"He was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1995."
"In July 1999, the monks of St. Otmarsberg Abbey (the youngest abbey in Switzerland) elected Eleganti the second abbot of the monastery."
"The Missionary Benedictines in Uznach belong to the Benedictine Congregation of St. Ottilien near Munich, with branches in Europe, East, West and South Africa, South America, Cuba and the USA, India, Korea, China, Kazakhstan and the Philippines."
"In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Abbot Marian Eleganti as auxiliary bishop of the diocese of Chur, Switzerland."
"He was ordained a bishop on Jan. 31, 2010."
"Since 2011, Bishop Eleganti has served as the Swiss Youth Bishop for German-speaking Switzerland on behalf of the Swiss Bishops’ Conference, and as vicar for religious and monastic communities."
He is also the vicar for the philosophical-theological education and ongoing formation and training of pastoral workers.
Bishop Marian Eleganti’s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine.
"To date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession: Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia; Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, former apostolic nuncio to the United States; His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy; Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria; and His Excellency Rene Gracida, Bishop emeritus of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA."
Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter
Haig's name was inadvertently revealed this week when unredacted court documents were released to reporters.
Search warrant records showed that Haig was a person of interest in the investigation of the mass shooting.
"""It makes me feel horrible,"" he said at a news conference Friday morning."
"""People need to do their research and think rather than just react viscerally.”"
"Many of their theories lean heavily on Haig's LinkedIn profile, which says that Haig previously worked for Boeing and Northrop Grumman."
"They noted Haig's LinkedIn page, which says he worked for Boeing in Mesa as a senior liaison engineer in their unmanned helicopter division from 2010 to 2013."
"""Let’s not forget that it is a fact that helicopters were lurking behind the Mandalay Bay during the attack which were not shown on the radar,"" author Shepard Ambellas writes."
"Ambellas and Intellihub claim that the FBI and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are providing cover for the real story behind the massacre, with help from Haig."
"In public statements this week, Haig denied any connection to the massacre and said he merely sold Paddock the rounds."
"""However, don’t be fooled,"" Intellihub writes."
"She wrote on Twitter that the massacre ""is starting to look more and more like a gun running operation gone wrong every day."""
Douglas Haig’s @LinkedIn Account says he also has “DOD Top secret clearance” on top of specializing in military ammunition.
He is the second suspect in the #LasVegasShooting.
"pic.twitter.com/ifkkglZ4kw — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) January 30, 2018"
"But Haig is an engineer, and he says he's not a former military officer."
"It should be noted that Haig's rounds were probably not even used in the massacre: Haig sold Paddock tracer ammunition, which emit a flare when fired making them easier to see."
"Had Paddock fired these rounds during the nighttime massacre at the concert, they would have been visible."
"Haig's attorney Marc Victor told reporters it was perfectly legal for Haig, a private citizen, to sell Paddock hundreds of rounds of tracer ammunition — the bullets are legal in Arizona."
Paddock showed up to buy ammunition at Haig's home after meeting him at a gun show in Phoenix.
"""I sold him 600 rounds of .308 tracer, surplus U.S. military."
"I sold him 120 rounds of .556 tracer, again, surplus U.S. military,"" Haig said to ABC15."
"""I put it in a box for him."
"He paid me, put it in his car, and left."""
"Haig said he's been legally selling ammunition as as a hobby since 1991, but after the massacre, he has stopped his side business."
"It wasn't unusual for a customer to buy over 700 rounds, he said."
"When asked about the threats, Haig said, “I’ve had people screaming they want me to die through my front door."""
Haig and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the conspiracy theorizing.
"Haig said he's sorry that the massacre took place, but emphasized that he had nothing to do with Paddock's mass shooting."
"“I had no contribution to what Paddock did,” Haig said at the news conference."
"Nevertheless, it's hard to believe that Haig's denials will dissuade the conspiracy-mongers."
"Even so, Morphonious still parlayed an innocent-until-proven-guilty stance into a 30-minute dissertation where he discussed a ""shadow government in the United States"" in the context of Haig's work for companies like Northrop Grumman."
"That I don't know — it's possible, but who knows."""
Morphonious said.
"He added, ""I've got some questions of my own about Doug Haig that I'm going to continue seeking answers for."""
The ammunition dealer who sold armor-piercing rounds to the Las Vegas gunman has been charged

A complaint says unfired armor-piercing bullets found inside the Las Vegas hotel room where the attack was launched on Oct. 1 contained the fingerprints of ammunition dealer Douglas Haig of Arizona.
The complaint filed Friday in federal court in Phoenix says Haig didn't have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition.
He was charged shortly before holding a news conference Friday.
He said he noticed nothing suspicious when he sold 720 rounds of ammunition to Stephen Paddock in the weeks before the attack that killed 58 people.
Haig is a 55-year-old aerospace engineer who sold ammunition as a hobby for about 25 years.
Pope Francis: Ross Douthat & Massimo Faggioli Debate Catholic Church’s Future
"Pope Francis visits Genoa, Italy, in May 2017."
(Reuters photo: Giorgio Perottino)
"In a debate, Ross Douthat and Massimo Faggioli discussed Pope Francis’s legacy and its effect on internal Church controversies."
"On Wednesday night, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat and Villanova professor of theology Massimo Faggioli came together for a debate entitled “Francis @ Five: Assessing the Legacy of Pope Francis Five Years after His Election.” As I made my way up to Fordham University, I was excited."
"Having followed Douthat and Faggioli’s ongoing dialogue on Twitter, I knew I was in for a lively, if predictable, conversation."
"In his opening remarks, Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis’s papacy thus far: his impact on the public’s perception of the Church (a success); his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy (a disappointment); and his position on “moral-theological controversies,” specifically, communion for the divorced and remarried (a problem)."

"Rather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better, Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of “continuity” with past popes, since doing so would assume that “Christianity at some point ."
.
.
"was complete,” which Faggioli does not think is true."
"While I emphatically disagree with this argument, I have to hand it to Faggioli: From the outset, he made clear that he was not planning to debate Douthat on the implications of the Francis papacy."
"To defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion, Faggioli invoked the case of Germany, where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce."
Advertisement
"However, the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful."
"Just before invoking the German case, Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world."
"But rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany, reasserting the Church’s position on marriage, and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws, Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society."
Advertisement
"It should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd."
"If the Church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity, then what is the point of the Church?"
"Pope Benedict XVI has warned against precisely the kind of “accommodation” Faggioli is calling for, writing that when “the people cannot cope” with God, they “bring him down into their own world,” and insist that “he must be the kind of God that [they need].” In other words, “Man is using God, and, in reality, even if it is not outwardly discernible, he is placing himself above God.” To fully drive the point home, Benedict equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf."
"Throughout the debate, Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel."
Advertisement
"Throughout their conversation, both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals, unbeknownst to most of “the flock.”"
Advertisement
"At its core, this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong."
"Of course not — that would be preposterous, as I’m sure Faggioli would agree."
"To pass moral judgements on papacies, presidencies, or anything else, we must have recourse to truth, and to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries."
"Whether in the Church or in the academy, we must resist this dangerous historicist impulse."

Illegal alien wanted for attempted murder in NC arrested at US-Mexico border
"TUCSON, Ariz. – While patrolling east of Nogales, Border Patrol agents assigned to the Nogales Station arrested Francisco Lopez-Loyola, a 38-year-old Mexican national for being illegally present in the United States Thursday."
"During processing, a records check indicated Lopez had an extraditable warrant from Catawba County, North Carolina for attempted first degree murder."
He was processed for immigration violations and turned over to Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office for extradition to North Carolina.
All persons apprehended by the Border Patrol undergo criminal history checks using biometrics to ensure illegal immigrants with criminal histories are positively identified.
"The Democratic Party promotes itself as an advocacy group for all matters concerning homosexuals and labels politicians, who take stances opposite theirs on politically charged issues such as same-sex marriage, as bigots."
"Yet, the party keeps on inviting an imam, who has a long record of hostility toward homosexuals, to participate at its annual functions."
"On Saturday, October 7, 2017, the Palm Beach Democratic Party held its 2017 Truman Kennedy Johnson (TKJ) Dinner at the West Palm Beach Marriott Hotel, in West Palm Beach, Florida."
The Keynote Speaker at the event was Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe.
"Other speakers included: United States Representative Alcee Hastings; then-Florida Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Bittel, who resigned in November over allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior; and then-Palm Beach County Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo, who was elected in December to take over for Bittel as Chair of the Florida Democratic Party."
"Prior to the speakers, there was a joint invocation performed by a rabbi, two pastors and an imam."
"The imam, Maulana Shafayat Mohamed, is notorious for his unapologetic vilification of homosexuals."
"Shafayat Mohamed is the imam of the Darul Uloom Institute, located in Pembroke Pines, Florida."
The mosque has been a haven for terror-related individuals and activity.
"Now-deceased al-Qaeda Global Operations Chief, Adnan el-Shukrijumah, was a prayer leader at Darul Uloom."
"And Darul Uloom Arabic teacher Imran Mandhai, along with mosque goers Hakki Aksoy and Shueyb Mossa Jokhan, hatched a plot at the mosque to blow up different South Florida structures, including area power stations, Jewish businesses, and a National Guard armory."
While terrorism plays a huge role in his mosque’s history – and he has been around for all of it – Shafayat Mohamed’s personal history deals much more in bigotry than terror.
One stop on Shafayat Mohamed’s Facebook page and one can view his profile photo of him holding a dark green book with gold border and letters on the cover.
"The book is “The Meaning of THE HOLY QUR’AN,” a version of the Quran that was banned by the Los Angeles public school system, in February 2002, for containing numerous anti-Semitic commentaries."
It is writings such as these that have gotten Shafayat Mohamed thrown off a number of Broward County boards.
"Even so, the imam has been unrepentant."
"In a speech he gave at Darul Uloom, in August 2015, titled ‘Quraan Torah Bible Forbid Man Marrying Man,’ he admitted that he “got sacked from many [county] boards, because there were a lot of gay people who said, ‘We don’t want him on that board.’” He said he had a choice, to “sit in Paradise or… sit on the board and go to Hell.”"
He began his speech by attacking President Barack Obama for supporting same-sex marriage.
"He asked the following, “Did you hear what President Obama said?… Do you know what a sad situation we are in this country?..."
Here you have the President of the United States of America saying that a man could marry a man?… Are we sleeping?
Do you believe in the Quran?
Shafayat Mohamed later lamented the existence of Muslim homosexuals.
"He decried, “Listen."
Don’t deny it.
"They already got Muslim gay communities.” He as well spoke of his support for polygamy, an act that is illegal in the United States."
"He exclaimed, “Here the President says a man can marry a man, but you can’t say a man can have four wives…!”"
The October TKJ Dinner was not the first Democrat event Shafayat Mohamed has participated in.
"In fact, he has been involved in many, including giving the invocations at the Florida Democratic Party’s annual Leadership Blue Gala in 2014 (featuring Bill Clinton), 2015 and 2016."
"And given that this author has written about this before, the October event will probably not be the last occasion that he is embraced by the Democratic Party."
Shafayat Mohamed is not the only Muslim extremist that has participated in the Democratic Party’s TKJ Dinner.
"Ruiz, as well, founded AMANA’s Connecticut and Puerto Rico chapters."
"AMANA is currently promoting another anti-Semitic Duke-produced video, on the AMANA site."
"By inviting people like Shafayat Mohamed, an avowed enemy of the gay community, and Wilfredo Ruiz, whose group promotes white supremacists, to participate in its functions, the Democratic Party has effectively revealed its disregard for the concerns of those it disingenuously claims to advocate for and protect."
It is time for Democrats to reject the bigotry of these radicals and see them for the liability they present.

Chile 'cover-up' letter contradicts Pope
© EPA Pope Francis's trip to Chile and Peru was overshadowed by he row
"Juan Carlos Cruz, a victim of cleric Fernando Karadima in the 1980s, accused fellow priest Juan Barros of witnessing the abuse and doing nothing."
"The Pope caused outrage after a visit to Chile last month by defending Bishop Barros, who was made a bishop in 2015."
The Vatican refused to comment on the letter when approached by BBC News.
"Pope Francis has said in the past that dealing with abuse is vital for the Church's credibility and perpetrators must face ""sanctions""."
What allegations does the letter make?
"Mr Cruz sent the text of his letter (written in Spanish) to BBC News, showing it was addressed personally to Pope Francis and dated 3 March 2015."
"The bishop has denied ever knowing about ""the serious abuses"" committed by Karadima, who was never prosecuted in Chile because so much time had passed but was convicted and sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of ""penance and prayer""."
© AFP Cardinal O'Malley (centre) accompanied the Pope in Latin America
"In his letter, he also attaches the full text of a previous letter written a month earlier to the Vatican's top diplomat in Chile, Archbishop Ivo Scapolo."
"""When we were in a room with Karadima and Juan Barros, if he [Barros] wasn't kissing Karadima, he watched as one of us, the youngest, was touched by Karadima and forced to give him kisses,"" he writes."
"""Karadima would say to me: 'Put your mouth next to mine and stick out your tongue.'"
He'd stick out his and kiss us with his tongue.
"Juan Barros witnessed all of this on countless occasions, not just in my case but in the case of others as well."""
"Addressing himself to Pope Francis, Mr Cruz says: ""Holy Father, Juan Barros says he saw nothing and yet, there are dozens of us who can testify to the fact that not only was he present when Karadima abused us, but that he, too, kissed Karadima and they touched each other."""
There are so many of us who despite everything think that you can do something.
"I treasure my faith, it's what sustains me, but it is slipping away from me."""
Hasn't the Pope already apologised?
© AFP Karadima was only punished by the Vatican
"The remarks that the Pope had made in January that caused such offence were: ""The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will speak."
There is not a single piece of proof against him.
Everything is slander.
"Is this clear?"""
"The Pope later apologised for hurting victims' feelings ""without meaning to"" but continued to insist there was ""no evidence"" against the bishop."
"""In Barros's case, it was studied,"" he said."
"""It was restudied."
And there is no evidence...
"I don't have evidence to convict."""
How far did the letter get?
© Reuters Bishop Barros (centre) was greeted by angry protesters at his ordination
"Members of the Pope's own Commission for the Protection of Minors, set up in 2014 as part of efforts to counter sex abuse by clergy, have told the Associated Press they hand-delivered the letter to Francis's top adviser on sex abuse, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, in April 2015."
"A photo in the AP report shows Marie Collins, a member of the commission at the time, handing the letter to the cardinal."
"""When we gave him the letter for the Pope, he assured us he would give it to the Pope and speak of the concerns,"" she told AP."
"""And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done."""
Mr Cruz told the BBC that Cardinal O'Malley had called him later in 2015 to say he had given the letter to the Pope.
"Cardinal O'Malley, whose spokesman referred requests for comment to the Vatican, has earned respect for his work in tackling sex abuse by clergy in Boston."
"In an unusual step, Cardinal O'Malley openly criticised the Pope last month for his initial remarks in Chile, saying he had left victims feeling abandoned."
"Pope Francis announced last week he was sending the Vatican's top expert on sexual abuse, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to Chile to investigate the accusations against Bishop Barros."
Tenth bishop signs ‘Profession of Immutable Truths’ in defense of marriage
"NewsCatholic Church, Family, Marriage"
"ROME, February 6, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – His Excellency Elmar Fischer, bishop emeritus of Feldkirch, Austria, has signed the “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage,” LifeSiteNews confirmed on Monday."
Bishop Fischer is the tenth prelate to sign the profession.
"As has been widely reported, three bishops in Kazakhstan – Tomash Peta, Jan Pawel Lenga, and Athanasius Schneider – issued a Profession of the Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage on Dec. 31, 2017."
"The profession was made public on Jan. 2, 2018."
"Ordained to the priesthood in 1961, Fischer headed the Marriage and Family Centre of the Feldkirch diocese from 1979 to 1990."
"After serving as vicar general of the diocese from 1989, in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him bishop of Felkirch where he served until 2011, retiring at the age of 75."
Bishop Fischer’s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine bishops and one cardinal.
"To date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession:"
"• Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia"
• Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò of Italy and former apostolic nuncio to the United States
"• His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy"
"• Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria"
"• His Excellency Rene Gracida, Bishop emeritus of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA"
"• His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur, Switzerland"
"• His Excellency Elmar Fischer, Bishop emeritus of Feldkirch, Austria."
Except when it's coming from inside the house.
It's maintained a solid boycott on reporting on the photo of Obama posing with Farrakhan.
Don't count on these comments by a Congressional Black Cacus member to get reported either.
Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “outstanding human being” on Monday.
"Farrakhan’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people “deserve to die” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “very great man.” “I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC."
"When asked about Farrakhan’s history of anti-Semitic comments, Davis was dismissive and said that many people in politics have a history of inflammatory comments."
Like this.
Obama's meeting with Farrakhan was part of a CBC event.
The Caucus has yet to apologize for it.
It just won't address left-wing anti-Semitism and racism.
"FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976"
"It was held at the Radisson South Hotel, Minneapolis, on Tuesday, May 12, 1976, and its stated purpose was to assist the Archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the Society of St. Pius X in the States during the unprecedented crisis Blessed Pope Paul had helped unleash on the Church."
"And for those of us who’ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight."
"Even though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican."
"And now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century’s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later."
May we continue to earn the right to stand with them today.
MJM
The Archbishop Speaks
Ladies and Gentlemen:
"As I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I can say in bad English what he says in good English, because he said all of the things I want to say [Referring here to Walter Matt’s introductory talk referenced above.]"
"And I thank you, Mr. Matt, very much, for his invitation, and I thank you for your coming, and I thank Fr."
Ward for what he said about the Society of St. Pius X.
"And I hope that you can understand my poor English, but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time."
"As Mr. Matt said, the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary."
It is very difficult to understand the situation today.
"My seminary in Econe (in Switzerland) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America, in Armada, are in very difficult situations with Rome."
Why?
These seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council.
"They have the same discipline and the same studies, they make good priests; I think they are good seminarians."
All is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council.
Why are we now in this very sad situation with Rome?
But we do not change.
We continue the Tradition.
"So why do they now say, as Mgr."
"(Archbishop) Benelli[1] said to me months ago on the 19th of March, “you are out of communion with the Church.” I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church?"
This is possible?
I do not understand.
Why?
I have done nothing.
I believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries.
Mgr.
"Benelli then said to me, you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council, you accept the reform that followed the Council, and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome."
Mgr.
"Benelli took the book of the New Ordo, gave it to me, and said, “You must say this New Mass in all of your houses.”"
I wonder why Mgr.
Benelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting.
[2] He could have done so.
"For example, one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter (Cardinals Wright, Tabera [Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz, one of the Council Fathers MJM], and Gabriel-Marie Garrone) telling me (in effect) that I must close the seminaries."
I am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church.
I do not destroy the Church.
And so I said to Mgr.
"Benelli, “No, I will not sign that writing.”"
And do you think this change in the Church came suddenly?
"When, then?"
At the beginning of the Council?
"No, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council]."
"In [1844], Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari."
[3] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.
And what did these Instructions say?
The Instructions said that they [the Carbonari/Freemasons] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church.
"The Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year, perhaps not ten years, but perhaps a century."
"The Carbonari must enter into the seminary, into the convent, into the sacristy, and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons."
"One day these priests, imbued with Masonic principles, will become bishops, and these bishops can then choose a pope."
"And even if the pope is not a Freemason, he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons."
Pope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church.
"In 1895, the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro, a known modernist, founded a masonic lodge in Milan."
"He wrote in his book, Il Santo, that “We [modernists]…want a reform in the Church…without rebellion, carried out by legitimate authority…even if this takes 20, 30, or 50 years.”[4] “The reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.” The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience!"
"And I think…well, here we are!"
In this time!
"The reform is here, and it is brought about through obedience, to the Council, to the bishop, to the priest."
"And all they say is “Obedience, obedience, obedience.”"
"The Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope, but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [“the banner of revolution”]."
One century before [the Council]!
"Thus, it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century, perhaps two centuries!"
"As the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French-speaking West Africa, I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council."
"There were some seventy cardinals, twenty bishops, and four super-authorities of the religious orders, among others."
Before the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject: one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea.
"The schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled “…On Religious Tolerance” and the other, from Cardinal Bea, was titled “On Religious Freedom [Liberty].” When we read these two schemas, we thought, “This is impossible."
How is it we can receive two opposing theses?
One says we must not tolerate error.
"The other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person.” And so, we go into the meeting."
"Cardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals, our brothers."
He said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong.
But before the Pope came (because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings) we voted on the schema.
Who is with Cardinal Ottaviani?
Who is with Cardinal Bea?
The conservatives and the liberals.
"As the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission, it was for me the first image of the future Council."
This historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year.
Isn't it time for you to subscribe?
"And as we go into the Council, you know that on the first day of the Council, Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council, [together] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine (such as Cardinal Alfrink, Cardinal Frings, Cardinal Dopfner, Cardinal Suenens, Cardinal Leinart, and Cardinal Koenig of Austria)."
This Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council.
"That is my cardinal; he ordained me to the priesthood, and he consecrated me a bishop."
And now this is public.
Nobody has been able to refute the publication.
"Now, some say the Council is (was) good, but only the reforms were bad."
That is not true.
Why?
"Because when the reforms come, Rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the Council."
It is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council.
"Rome said in the name of the Declaration of Liturgy, we [implement] the liturgical reform."
"We can say that [these bad changes are] not in the text of the Declaration, but this man has the authority to say that this is from the Council."
They know that.
And I am sure that it [the mutation] is in the Council.
"Even if it is not explicitly [stated] in the Council but [rather] in the spirit of the Council, it is the same!"
"For example, with religious freedom: now the Holy See and all the Nuncios are against the Catholic State in the name of the Council - in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom."
I have heard this (personally) twice.
The first time I was in Columbia.
"When I was in Columbia, I read in the paper about the change in the first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Columbia."
[The first article] stated that only the Republic of Columbia recognizes only the Catholic religion.
They changed it.
They removed this article.
I read the discourse of the President of Columbia with the Nuncios of Columbia and the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference in Columbia.
"He said to the people, “even though we remove this article we remain Catholic."
"Then, the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason: all of it was “progress,” “humanity,” “evolution,” and all the hubris of a Freemason."
"But I will never…I do not accept the concept, because you destroy the Catholic State in the name of the Council."
Are you sure?
"Yes, sure."
It is evident.
"Now I said to the [Secretary], “As I speak with you now about Columbia, I know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of Valais in Switzerland one year ago."
The change in the Constitution of Valais was the same.” (Because you know Switzerland is a Federation where some states are Protestant and some states are Catholic.
The Valais is Catholic.
"And in its constitution, the words of the first article [of the constitution] of the State of Valais – Econe, where we are located, is in the State of Valais - only one religion is recognized: The Catholic Church.)"
"And [the Secretary] said, “Yes, I am responsible for this change.” Brother, what did you do with the Social Kingship of Christ?"
What is this for you?
"What do you say when you say “thy kingdom come” in your prayer, the Our Father?"
"“Ah,” the Nuncio said to me, “Now it is impossible.” What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Quas Primas?"
"“Ah, but now the Pope cannot write an encyclical like Quas Primas.”"
It is incredible.
"If we cannot set out the true principles of the Church, if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world…"
[missing audio...]
The truth is the only one King of the World is Jesus Christ.
"We say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, “Tu solus Altissimus,” “Tu solus Dominus,” “You alone are the Highest,” “You alone are the Lord.” But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same."
We cannot say that.
We know that in many states (it is a pity) it is impossible [to recognize Catholicism as the state religion].
And the change in the liturgy is very important.
It is very bad.
"One of the principles of modern man, as they say now, “modern man,” is democracy."
And democracy can have a good sense but not if [by that term is meant] that those who govern receive their authority from the people.
That is not true.
It is impossible.
And our liturgy is the school of our Faith.
It is the first school of our Faith for all people.
I was in Africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years.
I know the liturgy was the best school of the Faith for people who cannot read.
They can see what the priest does.
They can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ.
And they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest.
They know that.
That is very important.
Because we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy.
The true liturgy is hierarchical.
Why?
"Because we have God, the priest, and then the people."
That is hierarchy.
When we are in Church we know God is on the altar; the priest is between God and the people; and the people receive God at the hand of the priest.
But now the new liturgy is more democratic - all around the table.
"The priest is only the president, and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal."
That is a new liturgy.
"That is very bad, because we have no sense of the hierarchical; whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life."
We need the authority of God.
We need the Real Presence of God on our altar.
We need the Sacrifice of the Mass – not a meal only – but the Sacrifice.
"So, the Victim of the Sacrifice is really present on our altar."
That is the school of our Faith.
"And slowly, slowly, this new Mass equivocates."
It moves the minds of the faithful in a Protestant [direction].
I do not say that all [Novus Ordo] Masses are invalid.
"But perhaps, more and more, they become invalid because [the ministers lose faith in the Real Presence]."
"Recently, in France, a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the Real Presence."
"But I think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age, they would find that fifty percent [have lost the faith in the Real Presence], because the young priests have no faith."
"Last year, Bishop Adam (in our Diocese of Sion, Switzerland) ordained one priest for my Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers."
This one priest came from France.
His uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river.
The uncle had nine children.
"The Bishop said to the new priest, “Now you can say Mass for your uncle."
"Now you are a priest, and you can say Mass for your uncle.” The new priest said, “No, never.” Why?"
It is not useful to say Mass for the dead?
"“No, no, it is impossible."
They are already in heaven.” This young priest who was ordained by the Bishop last year for my Congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in Switzerland.
"They are not learning theology, not philosophy, not anything."
Another example.
"Recently, I had two young [potential] seminarians come to my house near Paris."
"One of them works in a factory, and the other is a university student."
They told me they were [considering] the seminary of Paris.
"I asked them, “Why do you come to see me?” They told me that they had a meeting in the house of the Oblate of Maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the Diocese of Paris."
There was a total of fifteen young men for all of the Diocese of Paris.
"We cannot remain in this seminary.” So, they came to meet me."
They said that Econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the True Faith.
They asked for admittance to Econe.
And I think that they shall be coming to Econe next October.
But that is a new religion.
It is a Protestant religion.
It is a big mystery.
There are many proposed theological answers.
I cannot subscribe to all of them.
Some say the pope is not responsible.
"Perhaps someone gave the pope an injection, a drug, and he is not responsible."
"Perhaps, I don’t know."
Some say there are two popes [(a body double)].
"Some say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope, and perhaps (we do not know) he gave his name to Freemasonry (thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave)."
We do not know.
"And because he had an indiscretion with his Masonic appurtenances, the Pope sent him as a Nuncio in Iran."
"Now, you cannot say that Archbishop Lefebvre said the pope gave his name to Freemasonry."
"No, you cannot say that."
"But if he was excommunicated, then he is not pope."
Illegitimate.
I don’t know.
It is a mystery I cannot understand.
"But the fact is that the Catholic Church is being destroyed, and now even the pope himself says that."
This pope has referred to the auto-demolition of the Church.
"Well, there they are."
They are the men who destroy the Church.
We must show where they are.
"I do not know, but it is the pope himself who said that."
And I have these experiences every day.
I visit many countries.
I was in Spain during the Christmas Holy Days.
"Then I was in Bonn, near Cologne, Germany, three weeks ago, to speak at a conference."
Many people came.
Many people are confused.
What is happening in the Church?
They are anxious.
But many people say that we disobey.
Disobey?
Obedience is relative.
It is not absolute.
"It is relative to the good, but not to the evil."
We cannot obey our parents if they command a bad thing.
We cannot obey.
It is clear.
"And I know that in Spain, for example, the situation in the Church is very bad."
"The new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are, approximately, communist, Marxist, and socialist."
"And so, a majority of the bishops in the Episcopal Conference of Spain are progressives."
They are modernists.
"Whereas, the majority of the bishops [from Spain] during the Council were conservative."
"So, Rome is responsible [for the situation of the Church in Spain] because it is Rome who approves the nominations for bishops."
"And we know in France, in Germany, and in Europe generally, that all of the young bishops are worse [than the bishops in Spain] in that they are more or less Marxist."
That is a fact.
That is impossible.
How can they do that?
I do not know.
I have not spent my whole life in Rome.
"I do know Rome very well, because I was an apostolic delegate, and I was in the Secretariate of the Secretary of State."
And I know that very well.
We must pray.
We must ask God to put an end to this crisis of the Church.
They lose the faith.
They cannot go into the church.
They abandon the faith.
You know that many priests have abandoned the faith.
Many priests have gotten married.
And many sisters have abandoned their congregations.
It is a pity.
And it is everywhere.
"I was in Melbourne, Australia, during the 40th International Eucharistic Congress."
"Cardinal Knox, who was the man responsible for the Eucharistic Congress, is now the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship."
You cannot go to that Mass.
This is a fact.
They also called me by phone in Melbourne to say I was on the list of the bishops [attending] the Eucharistic Congress.
They asked me to concelebrate Mass with a Protestant pastor and a rabbi.
[applause]
This change is not accidental.
It is not superficial.
It is very deep.
Very bad.
It is against our faith.
"And so, we cannot accept this Council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from Rome."
From Rome we expect only the good.
"We do not expect the bad, the ill. We do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the Mass."
We need this adoration.
We need to have the faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ.
"Because all [of this change] is [oriented] against the divinity of Jesus Christ, against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Mass."
"It is a sin when we abandon the truth of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, everywhere, and we abandon the Faith of the divinity of Jesus Christ."
He is King because he is God.
He is the Son of God.
"So, He is King by His nature."
This is essential.
"And so, we cannot accept the diminution of this Truth."
Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
Jesus Christ is God.
That is a fundamental truth of our Faith.
And it all depends on this Truth.
And we know now that the theologians and the bishops have [a new orientation].
They do not express this truth clearly and perfectly.
They are afraid of the truth.
That is very bad.
And it is the same in Rome.
"I think they refuse [to grant me an audience with] the pope, [because they are afraid of the Truth]."
"When I was in Rome one month ago, Mgr."
Benelli told me he visits the pope every day.
"He said that when he left me, he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting."
"Immediately, he said, he would be going."
"So, why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope?"
Because they are afraid.
Meanwhile the Vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned.
"Here, again, is Blessed Paul VI, famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Peter's:"
"Cardinal Villot said, “We are afraid if Msgr."
He is a mysterious man.
We cannot give a definition of the man.
"He expresses the truth, and then he does the contrary/opposite."
Some part of him will speak the truth.
Another part of him is open to error.
Very curious.
And they are afraid that if I reveal the truth [and tell the Pope] “you must affirm the Kingdom of Jesus Christ everywhere and always each day.
"You must affirm the Real Presence in the Mass - in the Sacrifice of the Mass,” then perhaps it is possible that the Pope will change his mind."
"And so, Cardinal Villot says, there is a confusion, and they do not want me to visit the pope."
It is impossible to admit me.
And I know the pope very well!
"When I was the apostolic delegate to Pius XII, I was going to Rome every year."
"And during those eleven years, I met Msgr."
Montini.
"He received me twice during the Council, for a private audience with the pope."
"But, now, with my position against the Council and the reforms, he says: “No, impossible!"
You must sign in writing that you [accept] the Council and all the reforms before I will receive you in audience.” But I cannot do that.
"So, I thank you very much for your encouragement, and I must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations."
"For the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe, Switzerland – applications from the United States, from England, from Germany, from France, and Spain."
Good young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere.
And why?
Why do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with Rome?
They know that.
But still they come.
"I ask them, why do you come to Econe?"
You know our situation.
"They say, “Yes, we know your situation, but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests."
We are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true Sacrifice of the Mass.
"And so, we are Coming to Econe.”"
"And as I have visited my seminary here in Armada for the past five days, I can see it is the same here."
We have very good young men.
I also have some Americans in my seminary in Econe.
"In six weeks I will ordain one American priest from Detroit, who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest."
But these young men refuse to become protestants.
They refuse to become modernist.
They ask to become true priests.
And it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries.
"So, I ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties."
"I think, however, they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries."
And we have confidence in God.
"Since I began this work six years ago, now, I have evidence that God is assisting us."
"Because it is impossible, I realize, to do this by myself."
"We now have houses in Switzerland (3), Munich, France (6), Brussels (1), England, Armada, San Francisco, and New York."
"In Albano, near Rome, we have a congregation of sisters where I have five vocations from the states (good sisters)."
And I am building a seminary in Switzerland.
"So, I have confidence."
It is impossible for the Church to change its tradition.
The tradition of twenty centuries.
The Church is tradition.
It is not revolution.

Vote targeting Jewish student politician was not anti-Semitic: McGill report
"MONTREAL – It was political disagreement — not anti-Semitism — that led to a Jewish student being voted off the McGill University student council’s board of directors, an investigation ordered by the principal has concluded."
"A joint statement from five campus Jewish groups says the report, released this week by principal Suzanne Fortier, “appears to condone discrimination against Jewish students at McGill based on the cultural and religious organizations they affiliate with.”"
"The controversy has its roots in McGill’s long-running debate over the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement."
"At an Oct. 23 general assembly of the Student Society of McGill University, a routine motion to elect a slate of directors turned contentious."
"Supporters of a group called Democratize SSMU, formed to fight a decision of the board of directors declaring BDS counter to the SSMU constitution, brought a motion to divide the election vote."
In the past they had been ratified as a bloc.
She also created a Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life and a support line to report incidents of intolerance.
Boudreau interviewed 38 students over his three-and-a-half week investigation.
"His findings, he wrote, do “not substantiate the notion that the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism,” which he defined as hostility toward or discrimination against Jews."
"Rather, he found, votes against Lew were “motivated by politics, that is, based on his support for Israel and Zionism and/or for his view of the BDS movement.” Protests about Israel’s policies cannot be equated with anti-Semitism, Boudreau wrote, though he said Lew’s belief that he was targeted because he was Jewish was “honest and even understandable.”"
"A statement Wednesday by Hillel McGill, Chabad at McGill and three other Jewish groups said Boudreau was mistaken about the timing of an anti-Semitic message posted online by Democratize SSMU."
"Boudreau’s report said the message followed the assembly vote, but in fact it was posted at the beginning of October."
They say Boudreau’s report “insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office.”
Lew was restored to his post as a director last month after a ruling that the split vote in October had violated the SSMU constitution.
He was not immediately available for comment.
"“The report does not present a full or accurate picture of the hostile atmosphere facing Jewish students at McGill,” he said in a statement."
"Fortier said the university’s next actions will be based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life, due to report in April."

Virginia man who wanted to join ISIS pleads guilty to lying about overseas trip
"NORFOLK, Va. — While texting with an FBI informant in September 2016, a Williamsburg man expressed admiration for a U.S. Army officer who shot and killed 13 soldiers on Fort Hood, Texas, according to court documents."
"Later that year, Shivam Patel, 28, tried to join the U.S. Army and Air Force."
Patel pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court to two counts of making false statements.
He faces up to 15 years in prison when sentenced June 4.
"According to court documents and prosecutors, Patel – who was raised Hindu before converting to Islam several years ago – traveled to China in July 2016 to teach English."
"While there, however, he grew displeased with how that country treated Muslims."
"His employer arranged for Patel to fly back to Virginia on Aug. 23, 2016, but instead Patel chose to travel to Jordan, a statement of facts filed with his plea agreement said."
Jordanian officials arrested Patel a few days later.
"It's unclear why, but court documents say Patel told taxi drivers and others in Jordan that he supported the Islamic State."
A search of Patel's computer also showed he researched how to join the Islamic State before he left for China.
Jordanian officials moved for Patel's deportation.
"On Sept. 2, 2016, he boarded a flight to Chicago, and the next day, he flew to Detroit."
"There, he met an FBI source and started talking about the Islamic State."
"But, he said, he was afraid of making his parents sad."
"Patel returned to Williamsburg on Sept. 6, 2016."
"Shortly thereafter, he moved into a motel his parents owned and started applying for jobs with the military, as well as some paramilitary organizations – like police and fire departments, correctional facilities and probation offices."
"While back in Virginia, Patel stayed in touch with the FBI source."
"He texted the source on Sept. 23, 2016, and expressed support for Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood."
Court documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State.
Simply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law.
Patel's crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017.
"Court documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012."
"Before Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges."
"During the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel's passport to confirm his travel claims."
"After Patel's arrest in July, investigators found his passport ""near"" the motel room where he was living, the documents said."

Uranium One Informant Breaks Silence: Moscow Paid Millions To Influence Hillary Clinton
"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."
"-Article 2, Section 4 of the US Constitution"
"Right off the bat, this appears to be clear bribery, and a case could be made for treason."
"However, it is now being reported that an FBI informant that was involved in the Uranium One deal, has told congressional committees that Moscow paid lobbyists to influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by helping former President Bill Clinton’s charities during the Obama administration."
The Hill's John Solomon reported on Wednesday:
"The informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement obtained by The Hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration, and more specifically Hillary Clinton."
"... Campbell added in the testimony that Russian nuclear officials “told me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clintons' Global Initiative."""
"“The contract called for four payments of $750,000 over twelve months."
"APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement."""
"APCO officials told The Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and in fact involved different divisions of the firm."
They added their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States.
"In case you are unfamiliar with Uranium One, it is a Canadian mining company whose sale to a Russian firm was approved in 2010."
"The sale gave the Russians control of part of the US uranium supply, thus why I reference a case could be made for treason."
"While Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility, Campbell's attorney Victoria Toensing told Sean Hannity, “[The Russians] were so confident that they told Mr. Campbell with the Clinton’s help, it was a shoo-in to get CFIUS [The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] approval."
They were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as CFIUS approved it.”
"In a lengthy report by Award-winning National Security/War Correspondent Sara Carter, she pointed out that following:"
"On Wednesday, he shared with the committee information he provided to the FBI and has in the past described his frustration with the Obama administration’s failure to stop Russia’s nuclear giant from purchasing 20 percent of American uranium mining assets."
"Campbell testified before numerous Congressional investigators that his extensive counterintelligence work on Russia and stated that during his time as an informant, he obtained information that Russia was continuing to aid the Iranian government."
"According to Campbell Russia provided the resources necessary for the nation’s nuclear reactors, despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with Iran."
"In an April 16, 2010, summary brief provided to his former FBI handlers and obtained by this reporter, he stressed his deep concerns about Tenex, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear arm Rosatom and its ongoing work to provide Iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program."
"At the time, Rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the Canadian mining company Uranium One."
"“TENEX continues to supply Iran with fuel through their Russian company TVEL,” stated Campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the FBI."
TVEL is a Russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Moscow.
“They (TVEL) continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor.
"Fabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of TVEL.” Campbell informed the FBI of the close relationship between TVEL and TENEX, both a part of the Rosatom group."
"He stated in his brief that while spending time with the Russian executives from both Rosatom and Tenex, that any mention of “TVEL is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned."
"I do not even raise the subject of TVEL to our friends, but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner.” In the briefs, he informed the FBI that “occasionally someone will mention having been in Iran but usually it is long after the fact.” And when he asked the Russians about these connections, he stated that they “occasionally speak of the relationship, i.e."
"equipment, consulting."
"I asked Vadim (Mikerin) if they felt there was a serious problem, and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion."
"His response was a smile and shoulder shrug.” But Campbell had provided the FBI with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the FBI, which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the Russians."
"Those transfers, which were made in bulk $50,000 sums and at times delivered in cash, occurred between senior executives of the American transportation company and the Russian executives connected to Rosatom."
"He had given the FBI irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same Russian energy company Tenex, were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions, he said."
"Senior members of the FBI, Department of Treasury, Department of Energy and Department of Justice were also briefed on Campbell’s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to Russia’s acquisition of the Canadian company."
Campbell's work has resulted in real justice being administered.
"In January, I reported:"
"On Friday, the Justice Department unsealed an 11-count indictment concerning the Uranium One scandal."
"Sadly, it did not include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but rather former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive Mark Lambert of Mount Airy, Maryland."
"Lambert, 54, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering."
"The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX."
"According to the DOJ: According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX."
"Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like “lucky figures,” “LF,” “lucky numbers,” and “cake” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account."
"The indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A’s services."
"In June 2015, Lambert’s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA."
Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing.
"The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others."
We also know the following about Campbell:
"Undercover FBI informant William Campbell has given written testimony to Congressional investigators after an ""iron clad"" gag order was lifted in October"
Campbell was a highly valued CIA and FBI asset deeply embedded in the Russian nuclear industry while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI
"while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money - which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian ""nuclear money laundering apparatus """
""" He collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period, some of which detail efforts by Moscow to route money to the Clinton Foundation"
Campbell claims to have video evidence of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.
of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.
"The Obama FBI knew about the bribery scheme, yet the administration still approved the Uranium One deal."
"To thank him for his service, Campbell was paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a 2016 celebration dinner in Chrystal City"
"All of this then goes back to things we have pointed out with ranchers in the western united States and how this impacts them, as well as the land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated by the DC government and the Bureau of Land Management."
"There is also substantial documentation that was discovered in Oregon that relates to this deal during the Oregon occupation in 2016, which got zero coverage in the mainstream media."
Are we about to see a serious shakedown in all of this?
"Time will tell, but I remain skeptical, as in the end, all we ever get is excuses rather than justice."
NewsCatholic Church
"GERMANY, February 8, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Cardinal Paul Josef Cordes criticized fellow German Cardinal Reinhard Marx’s suggestion that Catholic priests should consider “blessing” same-sex relationships liturgically."
Dr. Maike Hickson translated it at One Peter Five.
"“The Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church’s Magisterium,” wrote Cordes."
"However, Marx said on February 3 that homosexual couples need “closer pastoral care” and “one must also encourage priests and pastoral workers to give people in concrete situations [of homosexual unions] encouragement."
Marx is the President of the German Bishops’ Conference.
"As LifeSiteNews previously reported, Marx also said “yes,” he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church."
This “encouragement” from priests which he called for might include some sort of “liturgical” recognition of their union.
"But “how this would be done publicly, in a liturgical form,” is “another question...that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way.”"
"After Catholic News Agency’s initial report on Marx’s comments, his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said."
"The cardinal’s office sent CNA “a request for correction of [its] translation of the interview in question, expressing concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.”"
Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx’s proposal.
"“There is no love – no charity – without truth, just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth,” he wrote."
"“Creating confusion around important truths of our faith, no matter how positive the intention, only makes a difficult task more difficult.”"
"“There are two principles we need to remember,” Chaput wrote."
This emphatically includes persons with same-sex attraction.
"“This in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing, but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage, the family, and the dignity of human sexuality,” he explained."
Cordes has a history of defending the Church’s moral teaching.
"Marx, one of the pope’s nine main advisors, said in 2016 that same-sex relationships have “worth” which must be recognized by the Church."

"New Horizons flew past Pluto in July 2015, taking pictures which revealed an even more diverse landscape than scientists had previously imagined."
"After the fly-by, the spacecraft continued into the Kuiper Belt - similar to the asteroid belt but further out from the Sun and composed of dwarf planets and frozen ice, rather than rocky bodies."
"Now, using its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), the spacecraft has photographed several Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) and dwarf planets at unique angles."

"The false-colour images released by NASA are the farthest from Earth ever captured by a spacecraft, and are also the closest-ever images of Kuiper Belt objects."
New Horizons was even further away from Earth than the Voyager 1 space probe when it turned towards the Earth on 14 February 1990 and took a picture of a tiny dot.
"New Horizons is only the fifth man-made spacecraft to ever travel beyond the outer planets, and many of its activities are setting distance records, according to NASA."
"Fortunately, the spacecraft is healthy and functioning properly, although it is currently in hibernation."

"Australia is, in fact, a country."
"The student, Ashley Arnold, is working towards an online sociology degree with the university."
"For one of her final assignments, she had to compare a social norm in the United States to another country."
She chose to compare social media use in the US to what it's like in Australia.
Australia is both a continent and a country.
"When Arnold complained, the professor said they'd reexamine the assignment, but did not concede that Australia was a country."
"That error made it nearly impossible for you to accurately complete your week 2 research outline correctly,"" the professor wrote in an email obtained by BuzzFeed News."
"""As I mentioned above I will look over your week two paper once again and see if you earned more credits than I gave you."""
"In another email exchange, Arnold correctly asserted that Australia is a country, linking to the ""About Australia"" section of the country's website:"
Again I mean no disrespect but my grade is affected by your assumption that Australia is not a country when it in fact is.
Thank you and let me know if I need to provide further resources proving Australia is a country.
The professor said they'd take Arnold's concerns into consideration.
"""Thank you for this web-address,"" they wrote."

"SPECIAL REPORT: Papal Cover-up Alleged, Pope Accused in International Sex Abuse Case"
"The press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros’ complicity in Karadima’s sexual abuse – not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant."
"Pope Francis received a victim’s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter’s author and members of Francis’ own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press."
"The fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has “zero tolerance” for sex abuse and cover-ups."
Now it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop.
"The Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, “had already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.”"
"“But with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to…Osorno.”"
"The article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros."
"The accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time."
"While the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse."
"The website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller."
"Marco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments."
"Without naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates:"
"“It was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy."
The nuncio has prepared the triad [the “terna” or list of three candidates].
"A cardinal, head of the dicastery, perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops, during the ordinary assembly took the floor, saying: ‘The first candidate indicated is excellent, the second is good."
"But I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality."
He responds little to the necessary criteria.
"But the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.’ The meeting ended without further decisions.”"
"Whatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference."
Bergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that.
"Even while “apologising” the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, “You, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven’t seen any, because they haven’t come forward.”"
"“In the case of Barros it’s been observed, it’s been studied; there’s no evidence."
The best thing to do if someone believes it’s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.”
"The AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O’Malley, the pope’s “top abuse advisor,” with the letter to deliver to the pope."
"Marie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican’s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, “When we gave him [O’Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns."
"On the face of it, there are only a few logical possibilities here."
"In fact, unless Cardinal O’Malley – who has, as of this writing, remained silent – comes forward and says that he didn’t hand the letter over pope, there is really only one; that the pope lied."
"And this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right."
"As Winfield writes,"
"“The revelation could be costly for Francis, whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5]."
"More recently, he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year."
"Vatican analysts now openly question whether he ‘gets it,’ and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn’t.”"
It was made in response to a question by a journalist about Monsignore Battista Ricca – a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the Telegraph as early as July 2013.
"Ilze Scamparini asked the pope about Ricca, saying, “What you intend to do about this?"
How are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby?”
What reply did Bergoglio give?
"About Monsignor Ricca: I did what canon law calls for, that is a preliminary investigation."
"And from this investigation, there was nothing of what had been alleged."
We did not find anything of that.
This is the response.”
"He added, “In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything.”"
"But Ricca’s activities, for which the pope claimed there was no evidence, were notorious."
"They include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute, and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army."
"It was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L’Espresso, who said the information was confirmed by “numerous bishops, priests, religious and laity” in Uruguay[6]."
"In fact, the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio’s normal procedures."
"And in case anyone was wondering what will happen next, the same advice said to keep on lying after you’re caught."
"The pattern of silence and, when pressed, flat-out denial has been Bergoglio’s policy since long before he came on the international scene."
"He has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement, and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off."
Perhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole.
"Indeed, on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people, it could only be measured in the negative numbers."
“Argentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis…”
"Though the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti-clerical, their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public."
On their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio/Francis simply isn’t interested in hearing from victims.
"“In Pope Francis’s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Wall Street Journal reports, including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops’ conference, he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse.”"
"“All of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later,” the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem."
"The site says that “in addition to Bergoglio’s failure to respond to victims, the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers.”"
"In fact, he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese."
"Weeks after his election to the papacy, he was quoted by his close friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, “In my diocese it never happened to me, but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this.” Francis added that he agreed with the “zero tolerance” attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict’s reforms – most of which he was later to quietly reverse."
"It was at exactly this time, however, that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope’s attention."
"One, known to the press only as “Gabriel,” wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio César Grassi, accused of molesting at least five boys, “who has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Morón and the Court of Cassation."
"So far, judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty.”"
"In case anyone thinks the Grassi-Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope’s attention, Bishop Accountability summarises, “A year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [2003] but before the start of Grassi’s trial, three men ransacked the survivor’s apartment and beat him.” These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case."
"Ten years [after Gabriel filed criminal charges], in May 2013, with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009, “Gabriel and his attorney, Juan Pablo Gallego, brought a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires."
An employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises.”
The group surmises that it was Bergoglio’s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals.
"In 2006, then-Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a “media campaign” and claimed that the Grassi case was “different” from other accusations."
During his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio “never let go” of his hand.
"In 2009, Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of “Gabriel,” who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse, but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013."
It is arguable that even the members of the so-called “San Gallen Mafia” who apparently conspired to put him on Peter’s throne were used by him.
But he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters.
"Looking carefully at the infamous “Who am I to judge” comment, this was clear early on."
"Recall that this was the very first airplane interview, on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio, a matter of weeks after his election."
"But perhaps in hindsight, we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech, one that was clearly well-rehearsed."
Journalists must submit their questions well in advance.)
Read his full answer carefully:
"I see that many times in the Church, over and above this case, but including this case, people search for “sins from youth”, for example, and then publish them."
"They are not crimes, right?"
Crimes are something different: the abuse of minors is a crime.
"No, sins."
"But if a person, whether it be a lay person, a priest or a religious sister, commits a sin and then converts, the Lord forgives, and when the Lord forgives, the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives."
"When we confess our sins and we truly say, “I have sinned in this”, the Lord forgets, and so we have no right not to forget, because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins."
This is important: a theology of sin.
Many times I think of Saint Peter.
"He committed one of the worst sins, that is he denied Christ, and even with this sin they made him Pope."
We have to think a great deal about that.
"But, returning to your question more concretely."
"In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn’t find anything."
This is the first question.
"Then, you spoke about the gay lobby."
So much is written about the gay lobby.
I still haven’t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with “gay” on it.
They say there are some there.
"I believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good."
This one is not good.
"The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: “no one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society”."
"The problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one."
"For me, this is the greater problem."
Thank you so much for asking this question.
Many thanks.
One of the pope’s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy.
"He starts by assuming, without any effort at defence or explanation, a point that concedes the whole issue."
This was the first time a pope had ever used the political term “gay”.
"Not “homosexual,” not “same-sex attracted,” but “gay,” meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement’s linguistic manipulations."
"In this case too, he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves, or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to “disagree” with Catholic teaching on sexuality."
There are very few “conservative” Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool.
"This astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity, an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up."
"“The problem is not having this tendency.” Well, actually, your holiness, yes it is, particularly in the case of priests."
"A few months ago in a piece for the Remnant, I talked about why the Church (and nearly all human societies) regard lying as a sin:"
A mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality.
But Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics.
Lying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality.
"Thomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil, and most unlike God, because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes."
"Habitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being, one that is by nature an opponent of Truth, ordered against Truth."
"This of course means that a person whose “orientation,” as we might say, is towards falsehood, even when he is at any given moment saying something true, is still servicing his lies."
He tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality.
"It was not by violence, but by lying and manipulation, by issuing half-truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not, that Shakespeare’s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature."
"Human beings are naturally ordered towards the truth, and we have to work at assuming a lie."
"This is why confidence tricksters can be successful, why lying works for getting what you want; people don’t see it coming."
"The first natural assumption is trust, at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time."
We therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust.
"Sociologists talk about the concept of the “high trust society,” one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately."
This is the way societies disintegrate.
"It has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful, and this is true."
Are we seeing it already?
Are we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on Amoris Laetitia and Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics?
With Cardinal Marx and others promoting “blessings” for “same-sex unions” are we going to be seeing an escalation of it?
I am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio’s support has completely dried up.
"Marie Collins, by no stretch even a “conservative” Catholic, echoed this concern, saying the Barros affair has “definitely undermined credibility, trust, and hope” in Francis."
"“All I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope, and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish, would find it very difficult now…and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks,” she told the National Catholic Reporter."
"There is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone, but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust."
Notes:
[1] “Not one victim has come forward in Chile; show me the proof.
Is that clear?”
"[2] The book “The Dictator Pope” relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high-ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope, whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State."
"It is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves, which may be the reason Cardinal Zen, in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience."
[3] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world… and drives the rest of us spare.
"Italians care about getting a general picture of what’s going on, where Anglo-Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details."
"[4] Though she never blamed the pope, Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission’s recommendations."
The time limit of the Commission’s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it.
"[5] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest – now laicised – approached some of the pope’s close advisors for help, including Cardinal Coccopalmerio."
"Sandro Magister reported after the “Who am I to judge” comment, “Before the appointment, Francis had been shown, as is customary, the personal file on Ricca, in which he had not found anything unseemly."
"He had also heard from various personalities of the curia, and none of them had raised objections.”"
"In what is being considered a particularly rare event, scientists are projecting that the Sun will be an unusually cool customer by the year 2050."
"By combining data and observations from decades of Sun research, experts are predicting a “Grand Solar Minimum” will occur a few decades from now, making our parent star dimmer and cooler than it has been for a very long time."
"The Sun might look the same to you today as it has since the first time you laid eyes on it, but our star actually displays plenty of changes."
"The Sun goes through regular cycles of solar minimums and solar maximums, which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm (the minimum) or incredibly active (the maximum)."
"These patterns repeat every 11 years or so, but new research suggests that there’s a pattern behind the pattern, and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way."
"The study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego."
"After combing the data, Lubin’s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum, making it a particularly calm moment for our star."
"During a solar minimum, the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots, and as a result, much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth."
"This can have a number of effects on our planet, including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground."
"Those changes can affect weather, though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult."
"The grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum, and could produce some very noticeable effects."
The most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s.
"The event, called the Maunder Minimum, is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over."
"However, other parts of the planet heated up, including Alaska and Greenland, to far above their normal highs."
Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government
"The McGill student at the centre of anti-Semitic allegations says he’s certain the climate within student government will improve, after a report into the incident was made public this week."
Noah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students’ Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro-Israel viewpoints.
They were since reinstated.
A report made public this week by Spencer Boudreau concluded he could not determine if students who organized against the three board members had anti-Semitic intentions.
"Boudreau, a retired professor of education and former ombudsperson for students, however, said he understood why the students felt they were targeted because they are Jewish."
"After criticism from several Jewish groups both on and off campus, Boudreau issued a clarification to the report, saying he could not determine if the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism, but he acknowledged there were “in fact anti-Semitic effects felt by members of the Jewish community.”"
"Speaking to the Montreal Gazette on Friday, Lew, the SSMU’s vice-president of finance for the Arts, said he was initially upset with the report, but felt vindicated by Boudreau’s clarification."
"“I thought this acknowledgement was very important and I really did appreciate that he clarified the matter,” he said."
"Jewish groups had criticized Boudreau’s report, saying it ignored anti-Semitic language used on Facebook by a group called Democratize SSMU."
Boudreau made his clarification after it was pointed out the anti-Semitic language was published prior to the vote.
"While Democratize SSMU later apologized for the language and deleted it from its site, the damage had already been done, Boudreau concluded."
"Lew said he feels vindicated to some extent, but is concerned anti-Semitism is still a problem within student government."
"“There have been some steps taken by the administration and the student body in the right direction, but it’s certainly not over,” he said."
"Among the measures taken by SSMU after the October vote was the creation of a committee looking into the issue of anti-Semitism within the student government, which Lew sits on."
"On Wednesday, McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier said the University wants to ensure a safe space for all students."
"In addition to ordering the report, Fortier set up a hotline to report incidents of of intolerance and a task force to investigate incidents of academic freedom and equity."
"Rabbi Reuben Poupko, the co-chair for Quebec of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said it should be noted McGill in general is a safe space for Jewish students."
Democratize SSMU did not respond to a request for an interview.

"Elnökségi ülés után Elnökségi ülés után // After the meeting of the presidency Posted by Orbán Viktor on Wednesday, February 7, 2018"
"""The presidency of Fidesz has discussed yesterday the announcement of the Belgian Prime Minister, that they will – if necessary with force – obligate Central European countries, including Hungary, to accept migrants,” Orban stated."
"“According to their plan, this will happen in June at the summit of the prime ministers in Brussels,"" he added."
“Our presidency has taken a stand: we cannot give in to extortion.
"According to the Hungarian Government's website, posted about the ultimatum that was given over the weekend."
"Over the weekend, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel spoke about sending “an ultimatum” to the Visegrád countries which “reject solidarity”."
"The essence of this ultimatum would be that if by the end of June a consensus is not reached in the council of EU heads of government, then the planned reforms would be adopted with a qualified majority vote which would overrule dissenters."
"“We regard this whole thing as unacceptable and we reject it,"" he added."
“The countries of the Visegrád Group do not support the introduction of any kind of mandatory quota.”
"Just this week, we reported that Hungary had grown weary of the talks of pushing illegal Muslim migrants on their country and Europe, and was preparing to walk away from the negotiating table."
Orban has taken a tough stance in Hungary.
"In December, he said that he was not concerned with what Brussels wanted, but was determined to defend Hungary's borders."
"PM Orban has done just that, too."
Orban's border wall virtually eliminated illegal immigration.

Puerto Rico says to receive $16 bln in federal disaster aid
By Nick Brown
Feb 9 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico said on Friday it will receive $16 billion in federal aid under a disaster recovery package signed on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump.
"That money includes nearly $7 billion announced on Wednesday and will help the bankrupt U.S. territory recover from September's Hurricane Maria, according to a statement on Friday from Governor Ricardo Rossello and Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's nonvoting member of the U.S. Congress."
Rossello said on Wednesday that Puerto Rico would get $4.9 billion to shore up its near-insolvent Medicaid system and another $2 billion or so under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to repair its destroyed electric grid.
"On Friday, Rossello and Gonzalez said the island would receive a total of $11 billion under CDBG, a program run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development."
"The additional portion would be used to help local businesses and repair and build new homes, they said."
"In addition to a slow recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years, Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with a combined $120 billion in bond and pension debt."
Congress could also appropriate more money later.
The governor has asked Congress for $46 billion in CDBG funding alone.
"""The work carried out in Washington - together with resident commissioner Jenniffer González - was able to deliver the message of the urgency of an allocation of funds that meets the needs of the Island,"" the governor said in Friday's statement."
"The disaster aid package signed by Trump on Friday - around $90 billion in total - covers a number of major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires."

PressTV-Sun to cool down in next 30 years: Study
"Scientists say our Sun will likely enter a cooldown cycle as soon as 2050, but the phase has almost no effect on global warming."
Physicist Dan Lubin at the University of California San Diego and two of his colleges managed to collect and observe relevant data for the past 20 years and came to the conclusion that the giant burning ball of gas in our planetary system might enter a “grand minimum” period of decreased ultraviolet radiation that would last for some 11 years by mid-century.
"“The cooldown… [is] a periodic event during which the Sun’s magnetism diminishes, sunspots form infrequently, and less ultraviolet radiation (UV) makes it to the surface of the planet,” researchers noted in a statement earlier this week, adding that “the event is triggered at irregular intervals by random fluctuations related to the Sun’s magnetic field.”"
"The study, whose results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said the Sun is likely to be 6.9 percent cooler than its usual lowest amount of activity in the grand minimum."
"According to the researchers, the cooldown phase could echo those experienced in Europe in the mid-17th century, called the “Maunder Minimum,” or the prolonged sunspot minimum, during which temperatures were low enough to cause London's River Thames to freeze over on a regular basis and to freeze the Baltic Sea to such an extent that Swedish troops were able to invade Denmark in 1658 on foot by marching across the sea ice."
"However, scientists warned that it should not be assumed that the ultra-cooling of the sun would potentially prevent the negative effects of global warming."
"“The cooling effect of a grand minimum is only a fraction of the warming effect caused by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,” they said, adding, “After hundreds of thousands of years of CO2 levels never exceeding 300 parts per million in air, the concentration of the greenhouse gas is now over 400 parts per million, continuing a rise that began with the Industrial Revolution.”"
The study estimated that the Sun’s mid-century cooldown would probably only result in cooling the Earth by some 0.25 percent between 2020 and 2070.
"As a result, the temperature at the surface of our cosmic home would decrease by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius, which is not sufficient to stop global warming, but it could at least soften its effects in part."
“Now we have a benchmark from which we can perform better climate model simulations.
"We can therefore have a better idea of how changes in solar UV radiation affect climate change,” said Lubin."
Online Sociology Course Founders Over Whether Australia is a Country
"I'm not all that concerned with students working toward a major in poetry, media studies or some of the more ridiculous courses some colleges offer."
It's sociology that worries me.
"The story concerns Ashley Arnold, a 27-year-old working on an online sociology degree."
"As part of her final class, for which she paid almost $1,000, students were required to complete a project outline last month in which they would compare a social norm in the US and another country."
"For her ""norm"" Arnold picked social media use, and for her country she chose Australia."
Why?
"Because, according to the teacher, ""Australia is a continent; not a country."""
"I believe I got zero or partial credit because the instructor said, 'Australia is a continent; not a country."
"However, I believe that Australia is a country."
"The research starter on the SNHU’s Shapiro library written by John Pearson (2013) states, that Australia is the 'sixth-largest country in the world' (n.p.)."
"The full name of the country is the Commonwealth of Australia, meaning Australia is both a continent and a country."
"Therefore, these sections of the rubric should be amended."
Australia's nationhood is not a matter of belief.
"Finally,"
the professor responded: Thank you for this web-address
After I do some independent research on the continent/country issue I will review your paper.
Who can really say?
"According to Zakkout, who sits on the boards of two anti-crime groups, Anderson’s declaration “makes a lot of sense.” With statements like this from Zakkout and worse, why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him?"
"Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a prominent Islamic organization headquartered in North Miami Beach, Florida."
"On January 25th, Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson, the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona."
Anderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS.
"In the clip, Anderson states the following: “And the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years, right?"
For 1800 sum odd years.
"And by the way, everywhere they were scattered, they were persecuted, hated, treated badly."
Why?
‘Cause God’s blessing them?
"Indeed, statements and beliefs such as Anderson’s have provoked hatred and persecution of Jews."
"Towards the end of the clip, which is less than four minutes in length, Anderson throws the anti-Semitism in people’s faces."
"He zealously states, while drawing laughter from his small audience, “You say, ‘Why are you preaching against the Jews?’ Well, don’t come back next Wednesday night."
"Because, next Wednesday night, God’s wrath is on the Jews even more!”"
Both Anderson and Zakkout have been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for their propagation of anti-Semitism.
"In July 2010, the ADL condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring an anti-Jewish video produced by former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke on the AMANA website."
"Besides posting videos from Steve Anderson and David Duke on his Facebook page, Zakkout also, in July 2017, posted a four minute clip from a speech made by Nation of Islam (NOI) leader Louis Farrakhan."
"Zakkout is also an ardent supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas, if not a member himself."
"In July 2014, he organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami."
"Sofian Zakkout.” The next month, Zakkout declared in Arabic, ""Hamas is in my heart and on my head."""
"All of the above testifies to hatred and intolerance, but it is even more disturbing given the fact that Zakkout sits on the boards of two anti-crime organizations: Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County and Citizens’ Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County."
Serving alongside Zakkout on these boards are local politicians and law enforcement officials.
"One would think that they would find Zakkout’s actions and bigotry unacceptable, as well, yet Zakkout continues to serve unchallenged."
"Once and for all, these groups need to divorce themselves from Zakkout and repudiate what he stands for."
"Beila Rabinowitz, Director of Militant Islam Monitor, contributed to this report."
'Oumuamua: Space Cigar Is Still Spinning From Mysterious Violent Collision
"And the interstellar object will continue to spin for billions of years as it journeys through space, scientists have reported in a study published in Nature Astronomy."
This is the latest of several revelations following the first-ever discovery of a solar system invader last October.

"""At some point or another it's been in a collision,"" Queen's University, Belfast, research fellow and lecturer Wes Fraser told the BBC."
The research team watched 'Oumuamua’s brightness change over time to model exactly how it was spinning.
'Oumuamua “appears to be in an excited rotational state undergoing non-principal axis rotation” the study authors wrote.
This unusual “excited” movement is better known as “tumbling.”
"“Tumbling is an unusual state of rotation,” Fraser said during Sunday’s episode of the BBC’s long-running Sky at Night show."
“It quickly starts to wobble around chaotically.”

The icy cigar was probably knocked askew by a violent collision with another object.
"The researchers don’t know exactly when this happened, but suspect it took place before 'Oumuamua left its home stellar system."
"""It's hard to know if it was during planet formation or after the planet formation process,"" Fraser said during the show."
"""Certainly, more collisions happen while planets are growing than afterwards, so that’s a very good guess."
"But unfortunately we can’t get a high-resolution image of this thing to see what kind of crater is on it that might be attributed to the collision that caused it to start tumbling."""
The team think 'Oumuamua may eventually move less chaotically.
"""The tumbling actually causes stresses and strains internal to the object, and that slowly but surely squeezes and pulls on the object just like tides on the Earth to remove energy from the spin,"" Fraser said."
"So, just how far is “the farthest ever”?"
Right around 3.79 billion miles.
"There are three images in total, each focusing on a different distant object."
The subjects include the ‘Wishing Well’ star cluster as well as two large objects in the Kuiper Belt which have never been observed from such a distance before.
"The images, as seen above (Kuiper Belt objects) and below (Wishing Well cluster), are somewhat grainy and not the most detailed we’ve seen from NASA, but that doesn’t make the feat any less remarkable."
"New Horizons originally launched way back in early 2006, and it the spacecraft has made close passes of a number of planets during its more than a decade of cruising through our Solar System."
"Its primary mission was set to last roughly 10 years, but was extended once it became clear that the spacecraft was healthy enough to continue sending back observations for a while longer."
Its new extended mission will wrap up in early 2021 after it performs a number of flybys of large objects in the Kuiper Belt that scientists want to learn more about.
"However, that might not be the last we hear from New Horizons, as its power source could continue to provide life into 2026 and beyond."
"If it makes it that long, NASA plans to use the spacecraft to study the outer heliosphere."

"Yore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse."
The Pope’s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false.
"Yore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was “told from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.”"
“The Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment.
"He received petitions and letters and calls, yet, ignored them all,” she said."
"As details continue to surface, the pontiff’s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well."
"The scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore."
Yore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information “extremely dangerous.”
Reports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse.
The alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile.
"Pope Francis received the victim’s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis’s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced."
The Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna – the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter.
Expectations were high in 2014 when the Pope created the abuse commission.
"And while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate, some have argued his actions in some serious cases don’t match his tough stances on abuse."
"Four members of the commission had met with Cardinal O’Malley in 2015, conveying their objections to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno."
"It was at the meeting with O’Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis, and O’Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope."
"Yore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision, between the Chilean bishops’ conference, petitions, letters and calls, that were all ignored."
"Further, a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified — including the letter’s author Juan Carlos — to be credible, and that there was a major cover-up of the abuse by Father Karadima."
Cruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard.
"And he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope, discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O’Malley."
"Cruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope’s comments that the accusations were slander, and there were no witnesses or evidence."
"“To hear him talk about us that way,” Cruz said, “calling us slanderers, it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims.”"
"Scicluna will be meeting with Cruz, who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront."
"“This leaves us with very strong evidence that the Pope was, in fact, aware of what has happened,” Yore said."
"“This is Barros present, in the room when the abuse is ongoing with these young minor boys.”"
She said she would argue as a child advocate that Barros was involved in sexual exploitation of children.
"“So I don’t think this is simply just a case, as bad as it is, of a cover-up of an abuser,” she said."
"Yore said that given the Church’s sex abuse crisis, one would have thought going into the 2013 conclave (which elected Francis) that an obvious priority in vetting candidates for the papacy would have meant a serious look at their history of handling abuse allegations in their previous sees."
"There are more cases out there just like Barros that have been covered up, Yore told Arroyo, maybe even some even worse than the Barros case."
“Trust within the faithful and to put in a system that was going to root out the predators.
"And I think that has just been blown up and I think we are back to square one in the Vatican."""

"Friday night, a drone, apparently modeled on a U.S. drone that fell into Iran's hands, intruded briefly into Israeli airspace over the Golan Heights, and was shot down by an Apache helicopter."
Israel seized upon this to send F-16s to strike the airfield whence the drone originated.

"In Syria's southeast, another incident a week ago may portend an indefinite U.S. stay in that broken and bleeding country."
"To recapture oil fields lost in the war, forces backed by Assad crossed the Euphrates into territory taken from ISIS by the U.S. and our Kurd allies."

"The U.S. and Turkey, allies for six decades, with the largest armies in NATO, may soon be staring down each other's gun barrels."

Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions
NewsCatholic Church
"SALZBURG, Austria, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – The indignation about Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode – the President and the Vice President of the German Bishops' Conference – and their direct or more indirect encouragement of blessing homosexual unions is growing by the day."
Now Bishop emeritus Andreas Laun – one of the signatories of the Kazakh “Profession of Truth about Sacramental Marriage” – has written a strong commentary for the Austrian Catholic news website Kath.net on the recent episcopal initiatives coming out of Germany.
"In the following, we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun's statement, in our English translation from the German."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net.
Cardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing.
"Now, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects."
The Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings:
"For Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service – whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day."
"The blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more."
"Some blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments."
But parents can bless their children.
"The faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family, but also the stable and the animals, thus blessing them."
[...]
What kind of hope is connected with a blessing?
"With regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection – sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers."
"With the weather blessing, one prays explicitly for protection against hail, lightning and drought."
[…]
"The blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense."
[…]
"But now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin."
"Of course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them."
"This blessing – which is not related to their acts – is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace!"
"What would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod, taking for himself his brother's wife, would have excusingly called himself an “individual case”!"
"The idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly, as follows: “Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.” [Isaiah 5:20]"
Is this not exactly what Cardinal Marx – and others who are thinking like him – are doing?
"If one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag “honey,” the cucumbers still remain sour!"
Even blessing bishops cannot change that.
"Nor can the pope, in calling for a cultural revolution, especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it."
That seems to catch on these days.
"For example, the Italian moral theologian, Maurizio Chiodi, recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden, but even demanded!"
"Nevertheless, one should wish for Cardinal Marx, Bishop Bode, and Professor Chiodi that they sleep well."
"Whether their conscience will allow it, is not so certain; but if it does not [allow it], it would certainly be a hope for their conversion."
NewsCatholic Church
"BRATISLAVA, Slovakia, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Former Vatican doctrine chief Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller has decried the Church's current adaptation to the modern world and rejected the idea of blessing homosexual couples."
"The remarks, made in a February 6 talk in Slovakia, indirectly respond to new initiatives coming from Germany, especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode."
"Cardinal Müller, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, spoke at a conference on John Paul II's encyclical Veritatis Splendor at the Comenius University in Bratislava, organized by the Slovakian Bishops' Conference."
"In this context, the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God."
"Morality, Müller explained, is rooted in Grace; that is why any teaching about “rules and exceptions” ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace."
"In the discussion following his talk, Cardinal Müller also responded to questions concerning Pope Francis' post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia."
The cardinal said that he is “not happy” about the fact that there are different interpretations of this papal text by some bishops' conferences.
"Contradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments, said the cardinal, lead into chaotic conditions."
"Archbishop Stanislav Zvolensy, President of the Slovakian Bishops' Conference and archbishop of Bratislava, told Die Tagespost that Veritatis Splendor is not only still valid, but shows timeless truths."
"Promulgated 25 years ago, the encyclical rejects authoritatively the theory of situation ethics, a theory that seems to be getting again much attention in our time, for example by theologians such as Professor Maurizio Chiodi."
"Professor Livio Melina, the former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family, was another speaker at the February 6 conference."
60 Illegal Aliens Apprehended In Texas Stash Houses
"RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas – In separate incidents, Border Patrol agents disrupt two stash houses resulting in the apprehension of 60 illegal aliens."
"On Saturday, February 10, Rio Grande City Border Patrol agents responded to a residence to assist local law enforcement."
A welfare check at the residence yielded 35 illegal aliens from Mexico and Guatemala.
"On Sunday, February 11, the Rio Grande City Station received a call from a concerned citizen regarding suspicious activity at a residence."
"Agents and local law enforcement responded and discovered 25 illegal aliens from Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil."
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) McAllen Office arrested one individual in connection to Sunday’s enforcement action.
No further details were released.
Puerto Rico Hurricane Recovery Worsened By Nearly 1 Million Homes Built Illegally
"But even before the hurricane, housing in the U.S. territory—where 43.5 percent of people live below the poverty line—was in crisis, and many homes on the island were built with salvaged fixtures and without permits, insurance or inspections."
"Government officials say about half of the housing in Puerto Rico was built illegally and without a permit, The Miami Herald reported Wednesday, which could amount to as many as 1 million homes."
"Puerto Rico's housing secretary, Fernando Gil, says the number of homes destroyed by the hurricane totals about 70,000 so far, and homes with major damage have amounted to 250,000 across the island."

"After 2011, the territory adopted a uniform building code that required structures to be built to withstand winds of up to 140 miles per hour."
"According to the National Weather Service, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds up to 155 mph."
Many buildings on the island were built under a prior code demanding protection against 125-mph winds.
"Furthermore, numerous homes have been built without any sort of permit at all."
"""It’s definitely a housing crisis,"" Gil told Reuters last week."
"""It was already out there before, and the hurricane exacerbates it."""
"One resident of Puerto Rico's Caño Martín Peña neighborhood, Gladys Peña, told the Herald that her home was built by people in her neighborhood and that fixtures for the dwelling were gathered from abandoned structures."
"""The one who designed it was me,"" she said."
"Florida Governor Rick Scott's office estimated that over 318,000 evacuees arrived in the state in the wake of the hurricane, and Federal Emergency Management Agency aid for Puerto Ricans living in Florida hotels will start to expire Friday."
"Still, about one-third of Puerto Rico is without power."

One Trillion Stars
The nearest neighboring major galaxy to the Milky Way is the Andromeda Galaxy.
"It can easily be seen with the naked eye from Earth, and it is found in the constellation of Andromeda, from which its name originates."
"Far from being just a pretty sight in the sky, the Andromeda Galaxy is an impressive, turbulent patch of the cosmos."
It is even expected to collide with the Milky Way years down the road.

Our closest neighboring galaxy is also known as Messier 31 or M31.
"The name came from Charles Messier, the French astronomer who catalogued the large galaxy."
"Messier documented many objects in the skies of the Northern Hemisphere, and they are collectively known as the Messier objects or the Messier Catalog."
(Note that Messier wasn’t always the first to observe the objects in his catalog.)
"In 1757, he had begun searching for Halley’s Comet, but the calculations given to him had sent him to a different section of the sky."
"That wrong section of the sky is where he observed a nebula that became the first entry in the catalog: M1, also known as the Crab Nebula."
"In 1764, Charles Messier added M31 to his catalog."
"By the end of the year, he had added a total of 38 objects."
"By 1781, he had logged a total of 103 objects into his catalog, 40 of which had been found by Messier himself."

9 Named After The Andromeda Constellation
"Photo credit: Keilana, Roberta Mura"
"If you look up into the northern night sky between Cassiopeia’s “W” asterism and the Great Square of Pegasus, you will find the constellation Andromeda."
"The star pattern was named after the mythical princess Andromeda, the wife of the Greek hero Perseus."
"The constellation was first cataloged by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century, and it is also known by the names of Chained Maiden, Persea, or Cepheis."

The Andromeda constellation is also home to various other deep sky objects.
"Andromeda is located outside the galactic plane, and it does not contain any clusters or nebulae of the Milky Way; it does contain other visible galaxies, though."
"The most famous of these galaxies is, of course, the Andromeda Galaxy, which gets its name from the large constellation."
"The constellation is best-known for the Andromeda Galaxy, which is one of the most famous objects in the sky that can be seen with the naked eye."

8 Larger Than The Milky Way
"In astronomy, a light-year is a commonly used unit to measure distance, but some astronomers prefer to use a unit called the parsec."
"When referring to something larger, they use kiloparsecs, which are equal to 1,000 parsecs, and megaparsecs, equal to one million parsecs."
"The Milky Way measures about 100,000 light-years or 30 kiloparsecs across."
"This may seem large, but it is rather small when compared to other galaxies."
"The Andromeda Galaxy has an approximate diameter of 220,000 light years, which is more than double of that of the Milky Way."
It is the largest galaxy in the Local Cluster.
"If it were bright enough, the Andromeda Galaxy would appear larger than the Moon in the sky (as depicted above), even with it being much farther away."
"The galaxy is 9.5 trillion kilometers away from Earth, whereas the Moon is only 384,400 kilometers (238,900 mi) away—that should give you a better understanding of just how big the galaxy really is."

"Solar Storm Will Strike Earth Tonight, ‘Weak Power Grid Fluctuations’ Possible"
The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts an aurora could light up the sky above areas in the United State including Michigan and Maine.
"A solar storm, which occurred Monday, is expected to strike Earth tonight."
"On Monday, the sun spit out a slew of charged particles in a moderate solar flare."
These particles are now making their way towards Earth.
"The planet’s magnetic field will block most of the particles, but some will make it into Earth’s atmosphere."
The particles collect at the north and south poles and interact with atmospheric gases to create the aurora borealis or the Northern Lights.
And some say this show could be quite spectacular.
"Solar flares have been known to cause power grid failures, but it looks like we’ll only get the light show this time."
"Although a grid failure is possible, it is unlikely."
"According to Seeker, the forecast calls for a high probability of a G-1 or “minor” storm, which could strengthen to a G-2 or “moderate” storm depending on how the stream of particles hit the Earth."
"Geomagnetic storms are ranked on a scale, with G at the bottom, R in the middle, and S as the most severe."
Forecasts now say the particles will give our planet a glancing blow.
"Although this storm has been categorized as “G-1,” which means it is minor, it could still cause some havoc down on Earth."
Solar flares and particle ejections are associated with sunspots — dark areas on the sun’s surface — that host intense magnetic activity.
"As the magnetic fields in a sunspot cross, NASA stated, this can cause a sudden energy explosion, also known as a solar flare."
"This sends radiation out into space, and that radiation can be hurled toward the Earth."
"G1-level storms, such as Monday’s, may affect migratory animals, and can cause “weak power grid fluctuations.” The barrage of particles may even have a minor impact on satellites."
But it doesn’t look like there will be any serious damage to the power grid because of this storm as of right now.
A colossal Neptunian storm just vanished before our eyes
"You don’t have to look far for fresh news about Mars, Saturn, or Jupiter these days, but Neptune doesn’t always get the same kind of attention."
The big frigid blue ball is the farthest planet from the Sun — since we don’t count Pluto as a planet anymore — and it hasn’t been studied with the same intensity of many of the others.
"Thankfully the Hubble Space Telescope hasn’t lost interest in the distant planet, because it just captured one of Neptunes massive storms losing steam as it roars across the planet."
"Storms on Neptune appear as giant dark ovals, a bit like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot."
"However, unlike Jupiter’s centuries-old storm, Neptune’s hurricane-like weather events only last a few years at a time before eventually dissipating."
"The planet, which NASA says is the windiest in our Solar System, hosts regular storms which appear as large spots on its surface, but scientists are still at a loss as to how they actually occur."
"“We have no evidence of how these vortices are formed or how fast they rotate,” Agustín Sánchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Spain explains."
“It is most likely that they arise from an instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds.”
The observation of this particular storm dying out is significant because it’s the very first time one of Neptune’s storms has been observed in such a way.
It also goes against everything that scientists thought they knew about how forms on Neptune live and die.
"“It looks like we’re capturing the demise of this dark vortex, and it’s different from what well-known studies led us to expect,” said Michael H. Wong of the University of California at Berkeley says."
“Their dynamical simulations said that anticyclones under Neptune’s wind shear would probably drift toward the equator.
"We thought that once the vortex got too close to the equator, it would break up and perhaps create a spectacular outburst of cloud activity.”"
"But this storm stayed its course, dying out in a horizontal path that didn’t bring it towards the Neptunian equator at all, forcing scientists to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new theory on the planet’s weather habits."
"Austrian diocese blesses gay couples on Valentine’s Day, makes reference to Amoris Laetitia"
"NewsCatholic Church, Homosexuality"
"AUSTRIA, February 16, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – The Diocese of Linz, Austria, invited homosexual couples to participate in the blessing of couples on St. Valentine's Day."
"The move comes in the wake of the recent debate over the German bishops' initiative to bless homosexual couples, as well as the controversy over Bishop Andreas Laun's own criticism of it."
"The diocese’s own media report makes a reference to Amoris Laetitia, as well as to Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent initiative."
"The official diocesan newspaper, KirchenZeitung, announced on February 9 that in two different parishes in the Diocese of Linz homosexual couples were explicitly invited to receive a Church blessing on St. Valentine's Day."
As is explained in the article:
St. Valentine is known as the saint of friendship and of love.
"In many parishes and ecclesial institutions, it is already tradition to offer blessings of couples around the time of his feast day."
People in homosexual relationships are welcome at the blessing ceremonies in Wels-St. Franziskus [Church] and in the Ursulinenkirche.
"Paul Stütz, the author of the article, explains that the blessing of couples “offers an occasion to express love.”"
"“The blessing expresses that one is welcomed by one's partner and by God.” At the end of his article, he adds a link to another report about Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent 3 February interview showing his openness to the idea of blessings of homosexual couples in individual cases as decided by a pastor."
As Stütz reports:
We give out that universally available blessing.
"There, we have nothing to forbid,” says Harant."
"As the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net writes, Harant must be quoting here AL 250."
"“We thus stress the high value of relationships,” explains Lehner."
"As the KirchenZeitung journalist adds: “This offer can be accepted by lovers in all kinds of life situations – also by lesbians and homosexuals.” Lehner, who is herself a theologian, regrets that, so far, no homosexual couple has come for the blessing."
"“Here with us, everybody should feel welcome, just as he or she is.” The pastoral assistant adds that “God is love."
There are no restrictions.”
The Diocesan Working Group on Pastoral Care for Homosexuals (dahop) is rejoicing about such a welcome from a parish.
The group says that it repeatedly receives requests from homosexual couples who wish to “receive a blessing in the frame of a liturgy.”
"The KirchenZeitung then quotes a commentary, saying:"
"It would be good if a clear sign of openness and invitation would be made by many more pastoral workers [male and female], in order to give the clear signal that love between two persons with equal rights are wished by God and thus already blessed."
"Moreover, the above-quoted Franz Harant himself is the contact person of this Diocesan Working Group – also called “Rainbow Pastoral.” As can be seen on the website of dahop, the Diocese of Linz offers special liturgical services for homosexuals, called “Queer Church Services” (Queer-Gottesdienste) that take place in Harant's own parish."
It is not clear whether these church services take place in a form of a Holy Mass.
"Similar blessings for homosexual couples are currently taking place, or are being considered, also in Gemany, some of them on the diocesan level, some of them on an individual level."
"As LifeSiteNews reported in January, the Diocese of Limburg is publicly discussing the establishment of a special liturgical rite for the blessing of homosexuals."
"Publicly presented by Johannes zu Eltz, a high-ranking priest of the diocese, his so-called Frankfurt proposal has the public support of the local bishop, Georg Bätzing."
"Additionally, the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net reports that there are two Catholics priests in two different German dioceses who publicly state now to have given many blessings to homosexual couples."
Father Christoph Simonsen (Diocese of Aachen) says that he has blessed 50 couples in the last fifteen years; Father Siegfried Modenbach (Archdiocese of Paderborn) has blessed two homosexual couples in the last years.
He also conducts church services for homosexuals.
Kath.net subsequently contacted both Dioceses and requested information about these two priests.
"As an answer, they were told that the Diocese intends to talk with the concerned priests, but that this matter needs to be addressed among the German bishops in general, such as in the German Bishops' Conference."
This moral turmoil in German dioceses has provoked concern and criticism among Catholics.
"Mathias von Gersdorff, German pro-life activist and book author, states on his own blog, the upcoming Spring Assembly of the German Bishops' Conference will become crucial in this matter."
"As he sees it, “the bishops of Germany who will meet next week for the Spring Assembly of the Bishops' Conference find themselves in a complicated situation,” where they will have to show their colors."
"They will either be in favor of the Catholic Church's teaching on sexuality and marriage and forbid such blessings, or “essentially accept them,” at least by “saying nothing.”"
He concludes:
Cardinal O’Malley will head revived Vatican abuse panel
"Cardinal Sean O’Malley has been reappointed as the head of a Vatican commission on child sex abuse, as Pope Francis on Saturday revived the panel in the wake of widespread condemnation last month of the pontiff’s defense of a Chilean bishop accused of witnessing and ignoring abuse."
"The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors lapsed in December, when its members’ terms expired, prompting concerns that the advisory body could be disbanded."
"In addition to O’Malley’s return as the panel’s president, Pope Francis named seven returning members and nine new members representing countries around the world, including Brazil, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, and India, according to a statement from the Vatican."

"Some members are themselves survivors of abuse, according to the statement, but they were not identified to protect their privacy."

"“The newly appointed members will add to the Commission’s global perspective in the protection of minors and vulnerable adults,” he said."
"“The Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our Commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm.”"
"Local survivors of abuse greeted the announcement warily, hopeful that there could be positive change in the church but saying the panel accomplished little under its first three-year mandate."
"“The objectives of the commission when it was first announced, when it was just getting started."

"were never fulfilled,” said Phil Saviano, an abuse survivor who founded the New England chapter of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests."

"Saviano said the commission is “a good idea,” and added, “I’m not particularly optimistic that much will get accomplished, but a commission is better than no commission.”"
"The pope said he had seen no proof of Barros’s guilt, but the Associated Press reported that O’Malley and other members of the commission had in 2015 hand-delivered to him an eight-page letter from a survivor that graphically detailed his abuse and said Barros and other clergy had witnessed him being fondled but had not intervened."

"Scanlan said his reaction to hearing that Francis has revived the commission was “hopeful but cynical.” Like Saviano, he said the panel accomplished little in its first incarnation."
"“My expectation is it will probably have the same outcome, because the church is the church, and they do it for appearance, but they’re still going to go by their own rules,” he said."
"Last month, O’Malley denounced the pope’s controversial defense of the Chilean bishop."
"Despite distancing himself from Pope Francis’s comments, O’Malley said that he has witnessed the pontiff’s genuine compassion for abuse victims."
"“The Pope’s statements that there is no place in the life of the Church for those who would abuse children and that we must adhere to zero tolerance for these crimes are genuine,” O’Malley said, “and they are his commitment.”"

Hungary's Orban calls for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections
(Fixes dateline)
"* PM Orban faces elections on April 8, leads all polls"
* Migration has been Orban's defining theme since 2015
"* Says will counter globalism alongside U.S., UK, Israel"
By Marton Dunai
"BUDAPEST, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Hungarian leader Viktor Orban called on Sunday for a global alliance against migration as his right-wing populist Fidesz party began campaigning for an April 8 election in which it is expected to win a third consecutive landslide victory."
"Popular at home but increasingly at odds politically and economically with mainstream European Union peers, Orban has thrived on external controversy, including repeated clashes with Brussels and lately the United Nations."
"Orban is widely credited for reversing an economic slump in Hungary and controlling its public finances, culminating in a return to investment-grade for its debt, which was cut to 'junk' during the 2008 global economic crisis."
"To achieve that and hold onto power the prime minister, 54, has used methods that critics have called authoritarian, and picked fights with EU partners, especially in the West."
"Eastern leaders, most notably in Poland, have followed his lead."
But migration dominates his agenda now.
"""Of course we will fight, and use ever stronger legal tools."
"Orban has for years targeted Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose philanthropy aims to bolster liberal and open-border values -- anathema to Orban, an advocate of a loose group of strong nation states that reject multiculturalism."
"A defining moment of his premiership came in 2015, as the migrant crisis peaked: he built a double razor wire fence that became the symbol of anti-migrant sentiment in Europe."
Orban also said the Hungarian opposition had failed to heed the call of history when it opposed his toughness on migrants.
Voters have responded favourably and Orban is a clear leader of all polls.
POWERFUL ALLIES
"Orban has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday."
"Orban has tightened the screws on non-government organisations, particularly ones funded by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university."
"Attributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle the migration crisis, Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration."
"""Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too,"" he said."
"""Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted."
It won't work.
"We are not alone and we will fight together ... and we will succeed."""
"In Europe, he cited as allies Hungary's fellow Visegrad countries Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, whose ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party is also often at loggerheads with the EU."
He said a victory for Silvio Berlusconi's party in Italy's March 4 election would strengthen the nationalist fold.
"""We don't think the fight is hopeless, on the contrary, we are winning,"" Orban said."
"""The V4 is firm, Croatia has come around, Austria has turned in the patriotic direction, and in Bavaria the CSU has created a resistance."""

"NewsFaith, Politics - World"
Orbán painted an image of Western Europe being overwhelmed by the accelerating influx Muslim immigrants in recent years.
"“According to estimates, the proportion of immigrants will grow at an accelerated pace in the European countries west of us,” said Orbán."
"“I won't even say anything about France and Holland, but even the born Germans are being forced back from most large German cities as migrants always occupy big cities first.”"
Prime Minister Orbán said his government will oppose efforts by the United Nations or the European Union to “increase migration” around the world.
"In June, LifeSiteNews reported that Orbán had taken a strong stand and not backed down against outside globalist influences seeking to control his nation’s politics."
"Orbán and Soros have a history, beginning in partnership and ending in acrimony."
Orbán started public life as a crusader against communism and attended Oxford University on a Soros scholarship.
"Soros, who expatriated from Hungary, also funded Orbán’s political organization, the Alliance for Young Democrats."
The Daily Mail report continued:
"But Orbán remains committed to his policy, claiming that Soros and supporters of migration are losing the fight."
"He said: “Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too."
Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted.
It won't work.
We are not alone and we will fight together and we will succeed.”
"In addition to inviting Soros’ ire, Orbán came under fire a couple years ago from the U.S. State Department under President Obama as well as the European Parliament for purportedly discriminating against homosexuals because of Hungary’s insistence on defining marriage between a man and a woman, and that pre-born babies have rights."
"Last year, Orbán also criticized liberals and encouraged citizens to give life to more children during the 11th conference of the World Congress of Families."
Three thousand “natural family” advocates who attended the four-day conference heard Orbán in his opening address lambaste the European Union (EU) for its “relativizing liberal ideology that’s an insult to families.”

"Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot"
Last week Pope Francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the Vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy.
"The issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years, and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests."
Here’s a look what drove the panel’s creation and what to expect in the future.
What is Pope Francis’ commission on sexual abuse?
"Following criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church, Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014, naming Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to run it."
"O’Malley was not only a member of the pope’s “G9” group of close advisors; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie “Spotlight.”"
"The revelations about Law, who died in December, emboldened abuse victims across the country and world, who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them."
"When he created the commission, Francis said: “The commission’s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.”"
Why is it being renewed now?
"After the commission’s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy."
O’Malley returns as chief.
"New members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, ""reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,” the Vatican said."
What did the first commission achieve?
"The Vatican has said it “worked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.”"
What didn’t it do?
Commission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists.
"Even if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests’ behavior, those strictures were not enough, O’Malley said in 2014."
"“There are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,” he said."
"But amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground."
"In 2016, Francis officially killed the plan to create it, issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem."
"Francis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell, whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances, was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault."
Any other problems?
But this simple message was hard to get across.
"It emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police, forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so."
Did commission members persevere?
Not all of them.
"British member Peter Saunders, a former victim of priestly abuse, was ousted in 2016."
"Irish member Marie Collins, another victim, resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission’s request — approved by the pope — to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims."
"Marie Collins, then a member of the pope's sex abuse commission, in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile."
Catherine Bonnet / Associated Press
Was the pope listening to the commission?
Possibly not.
"In 2015, Collins handed O’Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima, who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010."
"Cruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros, a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile."
"""I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence,"" he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz."
"Vatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission."
So is the pope intransigent on Barros?
No.
"Something changed his mind after his Chilean trip, possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country."
"On Feb. 17, he sent a senior Vatican sex abuse investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to New York to interview Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia."
"""For the first time I felt that someone is listening,"" Cruz said after the meeting."
What happens next?
"“This should lead to Barros stepping down,” said Saunders, who is forming his own campaign group with Cruz and others to fight clerical abuse."
The new papal commission will meanwhile hold its first meeting in April.

Brazilian arms dealer arrested in the United States
Inspector Fabricio Oliveira of Rio de Janeiro’s police department says Frederik Barbieri was arrested Saturday morning at his home in Florida.
He did not know the specific location of Barbieri’s house and said that American authorities will provide details on the arrest next week.
"Oliveira said that police seized 60 AK-47, AR-10 and G3 rifles Barbieri had sent to Rio’s international airport last May to supply drug traffickers operating in Rio de Janeiro slums."
The Justice Ministry said in a brief statement issued Saturday that Barbieri’s extradition has been requested.
ICE arrests 145 in South and Central Texas during 7-day operation targeting criminal aliens
"SAN ANTONIO — Deportation officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 145 criminal aliens and immigration violators in South and Central Texas during a seven-day enforcement action, which ended Feb. 16."
"During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Texas cities and towns: Austin (45), San Antonio (41), Rio Grande Valley (37), Laredo (15) and Waco (7)."
"Of the 145 arrested, 86 had criminal convictions; 39 were arrested based on previous immigration encounters, four of which have pending criminal charges; 20 had no prior immigration history or encounters, one has pending criminal charges."
Of the total arrests 135 were men and 10 were women.
They range in age from 18 to 62 years old.
"Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following countries: Mexico (128), Guatemala (7), El Salvador (1), Honduras (7), Peru (1) and Jordan (1)."
"Most of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: indecency with a child, assault, deadly conduct, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, drug possession, drug trafficking, burglary, resisting arrest, firearms offense, alien smuggling, illegally entering the U.S., and driving under the influence (DUI)."
"Sixty one of those arrested illegally re-entered the United States after having been previously deported, which is a felony."
"Depending on an alien’s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted."
Following are criminal summaries of three offenders arrested during this operation:
"Feb. 14 – A previously deported 42-year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in Harlingen, Texas."
"He was convicted in 2011 of indecency with a child, a felony, and was sentenced to 10 years’ probation."
He is currently facing federal criminal charges for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported.
He remains in U.S.
Marshals custody pending the outcome of his criminal case.
Feb. 15 – A 42- year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in San Antonio.
He was convicted in 2008 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to four months in federal prison.
"In October 2017, he was convicted for DUI and sentenced to 15 months in prison."
He is currently in ICE custody pending removal.
Feb. 13 – A previously deported 40-year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in San Antonio.
"He was previously removed to Mexico in 2009 after he illegally entered the United States through Laredo, Texas."
"Sometime after 2009, he illegally re-entered the United States and was arrested at his residence where officers discovered six handguns in his possession."
"He is being prosecuted for re-entry after deportation, and illegal alien possessing a firearm."
He remains in U.S.
Marshals custody pending the outcome of his criminal case.
“ICE’s leadership has made clear that ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.
"All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and – if found removable by final order – removal from the United States."
"These aliens are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and, when appropriate, they are arrested by ICE officers."
DOJ May Hit #Resistance Mayor Who Warned Illegal Criminals w/Obstruction of Justice
"Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, slammed Mayor Schaaf, who on Saturday night released an unprecedented warning that ICE was about to begin arresting people."
"Schaaf said she issued the alert after receiving confidential tips from “credible sources,” and conferring with attorneys to make sure she wasn’t opening herself up to federal prosecution."
Now the DOJ is looking into Schaaf.
The Department of Justice is looking into whether Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf obstructed justice by warning Northern California residents of an impending raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
And those who collaborate with illegal alien gang members should face the consequences.
ICE Arrests Over 150 in Bay Area
"Fox News reports that “targeted immigration enforcement operations” resulted in the arrests, about half of which snared fugitives with convictions for assault and battery, crimes against children, weapons charges and DUI."
One such fugitive is a documented gang member whose “accumulated criminal convictions in California... have resulted in more than 15 years of prison sentencings” and who had previously been removed by ICE four times.
Many of the other arrested illegals had criminal convictions from Mexico and Guatemala throughout Northern California.
This did not win her any friends among law enforcement.
"ICE Deputy Director Thomas Homan said in a statement Tuesday,"
Fox News notes that ICE officials are asking the Department of Justice to look into whether she broke any laws by doing so.
Dem Congressman Corrects ADL's Claim That He Isn't Into Farrakhan
The media has maintained a tight embargo on the release of the photo of Obama meeting with Nation of Islam hate group leader Louis Farrakhan at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting.
Almost no national media outlet has covered the story.
CNN only mentioned it when it embedded Jake Tapper's tweets about the support for Farrakhan by Women's March leaders.
But Rep. Danny Davis had defended Farrakhan.
Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “outstanding human being” on Monday.
"Farrakhan’s history of racially extreme comments includes blaming Jews for the September 11 attacks, saying white people “deserve to die” and praising Adolf Hitler as a “very great man.” “I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told TheDC."
"“He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.” The official said the ADL had shared information with Davis about Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements, and that the organization was waiting to hear back from him."
“I think that was what they wanted to write.
"Nah, I don’t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don’t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,” Davis said."
“That’s just one segment of what goes on in our world.
"For those heavy into it, that’s their thing, but it ain’t my thing,” he said"
Somehow I don't think a white congressman would get away with saying that he agrees with David Duke on the environment but isn't especially concerned about his racism.
But black leaders have gotten away with playing that game with Farrakhan repeatedly.
Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials announced this week that the four-day raid led to the arrest of 232 illegal immigrants in the San Francisco Bay Area.
"Of those 232, 180 “were either convicted criminals, had been issued a final order of removal and failed to depart the United States, or had been previously removed” from the country and had come back illegally."
"The arrests included 115 who ""had prior felony convictions for serious or violent offenses, such as child sex crimes, weapons charges and assault, or had past convictions for significant or multiple misdemeanors."""
"The numbers might have been greater, but for the intervention of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who tweeted out a warning of the impending raid, tipping off others who might have been caught..."
"""I did what I believe was right for my community as well as to protect public safety,"" Schaaf said Friday, according to NBC Bay Area."
"""People should be able to live without fear or panic and know their rights and responsibilities as well as their recourses."""
ICE arrests 20 in Kansas City during 4-day operation targeting criminal aliens
"KANSAS CITY, Mo."
"— Federal officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 20 criminal aliens and immigration violators in the Kansas City metro area during a four-day enforcement operation, which ended Thursday."
"During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Missouri cities: St. Joseph (6), Belton (1), Blue Springs (1), Independence (2) and Kansas City (6)."
ICE officers also made arrests in the Kansas cities of Olathe (3) and Lawrence (1).
"Fifteen men and five women, ages ranging 18-61, were arrested."
"Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following countries: Brazil (1), El Salvador (3), Guatemala (6), Honduras (1), Mexico (7), Romania (1) and Sierra Leone (1)."
"Several of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included driving under the influence, child neglect, child abuse, drug offenses, fraud and larceny."
"Four of these were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony."
Two overstayed lawful visits to the U.S.
All were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act.
The following are criminal summaries of some of the offenders arrested in the Kansas City area during this operation:
"A 55-year-old, Mexican citizen who overstayed a lawful visit to the U.S. by more than 12 years."
"She was arrested Feb. 26, 2018 in Johnson County Kansas."
She was previously convicted of child neglect and was sentenced to a year in jail.
She is currently in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.
"On Feb. 28, 2018, a 38-year-old Mexican citizen was arrested in Olathe, Kansas."
He has a 2012 conviction for fraud.
He was issued a warrant of removal and was placed in ICE custody pending removal from the United States.
"Depending on an alien’s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted."
"For more on Farrakhan, check out his profile here at Discover the Networks, the Horowitz Freedom Center's resource site of the left."
"Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf tweeted out an impending warning of the four-day raid last week, alerting targeted individuals to the imminent arrests, and infuriating Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, who say that many more could have been caught if they hadn't been warned."
"One Mexican citizen had convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and a conviction for driving under the influence (DUI), and had been deported in 2003."
"Another who evaded capture had a conviction for sodomizing a drugged victim in 2012, as well as a DUI from this year -- that Mexican citizen had also been previously deported in 2013."
"Another illegal immigrant from Mexico, previously deported in 2014 for a conviction for armed robbery, also evaded capture."
The plan is not to “control” the private ownership of firearms; it is to PROHIBIT the private ownership of firearms.
Donald Trump was elected on the promise of protecting the Second Amendment (among other things).
"As I reported in this column last week, in a bipartisan meeting with congressmen and senators recently, President Trump “voiced support for confiscating guns from certain individuals deemed to be dangerous, even if it violates due process rights."
"“‘I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida … to go to court would have taken a long time,’ Trump said at a meeting with lawmakers on school safety and gun violence."
“Trump was responding to comments from Vice President Pence that families and local law enforcement should have more tools to report potentially dangerous individuals with weapons.
"“‘Or, Mike, take the firearms first, and then go to court,’ Trump responded.”"
See the column here:
Florida School Massacre Proves Police Are Worthless In Protecting Us
"So far, five states have passed “red flag” laws that allow police agencies to confiscate guns from someone deemed to be “dangerous” by either a law enforcement officer or a family member BEFORE the individual has committed any crime, and in one State (Rhode Island) the governor issued an executive order implementing a “red flag” law."
Here are the six states where the legislatures have already passed—or the governor has already issued an executive order implementing—“red flag” laws:
California
Connecticut
Indiana
Oregon
Washington
Rhode Island
These are:
Alabama
Alaska
Arizona
Delaware
Florida
Hawaii
Illinois
Iowa
Kansas
Kentucky
Maryland
Massachusetts
Michigan
Minnesota
Missouri
New Jersey
New York
North Carolina
Ohio
Pennsylvania
Tennessee
Utah
Vermont
Virginia
And it’s not taking long for law enforcement agencies in the above states to begin their Naziesque assault on gun owners.
"This report is from Seattle:Doubtless, many other states are also considering passing “red flag” laws."
“The city’s police department became the first law enforcement agency in the state to force the surrender of a firearm under a new law known as an ‘extreme risk protection order.’
"“The incident involves a man who lives in Belltown, who neighbors said had been intimidating people for the past year – even staring-down customers through store-front windows with a gun holstered at his side."
"“Mental illness is suspected, but that new law allowed police to legally disarm him.”"
"“The man, who we are not naming, is also well known to the bars and restaurants below his unit along Second Ave."
The volume of complaints convinced Seattle police to seek an extreme risk protection order – or ‘erpo’ – which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.
"“In this case, the man refused to comply."
"Because of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.”"
"“A few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over."
"“Law enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings – such as what happened in Parkland, Florida."
“‘There’s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms.
"The “erpos” give us that tool now as an option,’ said Sgt."
"Eric Pisconski, who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department."
"“The confiscations only last a year, although they can be renewed.”"
See the report here:
Seattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law
A few observations are in order here:
"Plus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way."
"Secondly, the man was “known” to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence."
That means nothing.
Known for what?
The report doesn’t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely.
"Plus, if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act, the man must not have been considered much of a threat."
The report says “he had been intimidating people.” How?
No specifics except to say he was “staring” at people.
It seems many politicians (and many police officers themselves) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself.
"Sixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn’t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him “afraid.”"
That the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone “afraid” is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and “bear” arms.
"Even when police forced the man to surrender his firearm, the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers."
I go into the “mental health” trap in more detail in this column:
Trump Set To Enact More Gun Control
"“Mental health” regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, et al., have been trying to accomplish for decades."
"Now, it is the “pro-gun” Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen."
Kris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas.
He is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School.
He wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these “red flag” laws:
The seizure of guns without any hearing at all.
The laws all contain an “ex parte” provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person’s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard.
This is the quintessential denial of due process.
The Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one’s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law.
"This confiscation is “temporary,” but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation."
Based on the testimony of one unrelated person.
The confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others.
But “family member” is defined to include “former dating partners” and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant.
"So a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner."
Using a very low standard of proof.
That’s even lower than the “probable cause” standard for obtaining a search warrant.
"In addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing."
"Within two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order."
"But even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard used in criminal trials."
"Rather, it need only be shown by “a preponderance of evidence” that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others."
What kind of evidence?
Things like the “reckless storage” of firearms and drinking habits can be considered.
Shifting the burden of proof to the gun owner.
"The long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely."
"Once it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove."
"To have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others."
"Freedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next, because, thanks to Donald Trump, gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country."
"And while you are at it, don’t overlook the federal Congress."

P.S.
One more time I want to remind readers that self-defense—including defense against tyrannical government—is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator.
"For anyone, especially a Christian, to willingly surrender their means of self-defense is not only a crime against liberty; it is a sin against God."
I urge my Christian friends (and anyone else) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled “To Keep or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.”
"Mark it down: Any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their AR-15 rifles would be unconstitutional, unnatural, and unbiblical."
I know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that Christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns.

The comparison of the Soros funded group that has stood with Hamas over Israel with Jews who were forced to collaborate with the Nazis during the Holocaust was indeed insulting.
To Kapos.
Jews under Nazi rule may have been forced to collaborate.
No one forced J Street to collaborate with anti-Semites.
Democratic Illinois Rep. Danny Davis defended Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as an “outstanding human being” on Monday.
"The congressman wasn’t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn’t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday."
“I think that was what they wanted to write.
"Nah, I don’t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don’t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,” Davis said."
“That’s just one segment of what goes on in our world.
"For those heavy into it, that’s their thing, but it ain’t my thing,” he said"
"The ""Jewish Question"" is a term generally used by anti-Semites today."
But J Street is stuck with its own Jewish Question.
How much anti-Semitism is too much even for it.
Left-wing advocacy group J Street said it is re-evaluating its endorsement of a congressman who praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
"The endorsement, first reported in the Forward, calls Davis “a longtime supporter of Israel and a two-state solution.”"
"“We take anti-Semitism quite seriously,” J Street’s statement read."
“We are currently in conversation with Representative Davis’ office about this issue.
We will get back to you shortly with a more extensive response.”
That's serious all right.
Seriously Kapo.
"3rd Highest Ranked Dem Civil Rights Hero Appeared w/Farrakhan, Won't Condemn"
The media's Farrakhan embargo is collapsing.
"And that's due to the hard work of committed conservative journalists who stayed on this story, especially at the Daily Caller, which got the Rep. Davis quotes, twice."
Some credit also goes to Jake Tapper at CNN and Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post for a willingness to discuss the subject even when their media outlets didn't want to.
The debate over the ties between Women's March leaders and Farrakhan made into a debate on the View.
And that debate involved none other than Valerie Jarrett.
The New York Times has now run its own explainer piece on Farrakhan and the Dems which mentions the infamous Obama-Farrakhan photo.
"There's also a quote from an Obama spokeswoman claiming that, “President Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life."
That includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan’s views over the years.
And maybe one of these days someone will ask him that question.
And then Obama can give a new remix of his Wright speech.
"""I can no more disavow Calypso Louie than I can my dead white grandmother."""
"Rep. Danny Davis, after defending Farrakhan, now has a statement condemning him."
"After a previous statement, Rep. Davis made an infamous comment about the ""Jewish question""."
So it probably still isn't over.
"South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn attended a 2011 event with Farrakhan and shared the stage with him, even after Jewish groups voiced their opposition to Clyburn attending the event."
"Clyburn told the Final Call, a Nation of Islam publication, that he was “not bothered in the least bit” by criticisms of his attendance at the event."
"As the assistant Democratic leader, Clyburn is the third-highest ranked Democrat in the House."
"His office declined repeated inquiries regarding whether the congressman is willing to condemn Farrakhan, and whether he stood by his decision in 2011 to shrug off criticisms of Farrakhan."
Clyburn is now the eighth House Democrat to have direct ties to Farrakhan.
The Republican Jewish Coalition has already called on the seven other Democrats to resign over their ties to Farrakhan.
But the story is breaking through the embargo.

"Et Tu, Benedict?"
(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)
"Recently an editor of a “conservative” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on."
"I declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies."
"It’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate."
Editor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.
"Our thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below."
MJM
Why would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?
We cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.
"Of all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously."
How content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.
"So strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind."
But this is not what we see.
"There he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud."
"“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?"
"Why, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?"
"If it is a deception, why participate in it?"
"In fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word."
Some insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.
"But we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely."
We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.
"There’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true."
Why did you resign?
Ratzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”
"If you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?"
"Ratzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”"
Why do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?
"Ratzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”"
And where did this “emeritus” business come from?
Does it have any precedent in Catholic history?
What does it mean canonically and doctrinally?
Ratzinger: “…”
Doesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?
Ratzinger: “…”
"A few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict."
"Five years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy."
"And through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture."
"You may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has."
"And still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized."
Who is the real Joseph Ratzinger?
"I have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine."
I think we made the mistake of believing the press.
We failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.
"This reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne."
"Frings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions."
"After this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned."
"Cardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:"
"“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card."
"Frings, Archbishop of Cologne."
"Blind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions."
"Now then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office."
Despite a reply by Card.
"Ottaviani, Frings sustained his critique."
"“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop."
“Card.
"Ratzinger, who did not change, continues it.”"
"It went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX."
"In his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:"
"The duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then."
"This implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word."
Neither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.
"Hence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty."
"It was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength."
"His was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left."
"And it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure."
"Kung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?"
Can we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?
Precious few.
"Why did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?"
"Is it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?"
"Indeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions."
He was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.
"Perhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this."
Is this why he resigned?
"Is it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?"
Fausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.
"Martini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy."
"Apparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia."
"By 2012, this had proved impossible."
I think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.
They were esteemed academic colleagues.
They were brothers of the episcopate.
They were members of the club.
"Any appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative."
Why wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?
Why is Walter Kasper a cardinal?
"When, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope."
"In an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict."
The monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.
"This is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome."
This was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.
Why was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?
Kasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.
"After openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal."
Remember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.
"But he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way."
Nor was he removed from places of influence.
Far from it.
In 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.
"In 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign."
Then Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.
"As Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,"
"Cardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age."
"But since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election."
"(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)"
"Excuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue."
Doesn’t anyone else want to know this?
Don’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?
Why was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?
"What are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?"
"My own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over."
The end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”
The New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.
There’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.
"By playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history."
It created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.
"And just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun."
As it had to.
"They, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same."
And their New Church is the only one left.
"We had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left."
"One of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era."
"For those still wondering, Bergoglio isn’t a shock, he isn’t even a surprise; he’s just the logical end result."
"This pontificate isn’t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper."
"Following what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced."
"Trump announced Tillerson’s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: “Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State."
Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!
"Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen."
Congratulations to all!”
"In fact, he believes Barack Obama got Russian help too."
“It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.
"In January of this year, our Intelligence Community determined that Russian military intelligence — the GRU — had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee."
"And the report also found that Russia’s primary propaganda outlet, RT, has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks,” he said."
Clinton City…
"IN MAY 2013, the Washington Post’s Greg Miller reported that the head of the CIA’s clandestine service was being shifted out of that position as a result of “a management shake-up” by then-Director John Brennan."
"As Miller documented, this official — whom the paper did not name because she was a covert agent at the time — was centrally involved in the worst abuses of the CIA’s Bush-era torture regime."
"As Miller put it, she was “directly involved in its controversial interrogation program” and had an “extensive role” in torturing detainees."
"Beyond all that, she played a vital role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and other secret agency locations."
"The concealment of those interrogation tapes, which violated multiple court orders as well as the demands of the 9/11 commission and the advice of White House lawyers, was condemned as “obstruction” by commission chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Keane."
A special prosecutor and grand jury investigated those actions but ultimately chose not to prosecute.
"Bottom line, George W. Bush/Barack Obama era foreign policy and intelligence doctrines aren’t going anywhere under Trump."

The Washington Post first reported on the story prior to Trump’s tweet.
Trump and Tillerson have had a fraught relationship for many months.
"Trump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy."
"Tillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president."
But he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies.
﻿
CNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday:
"On Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave."
"He “did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason” for his firing, the spokesman added."
Two White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday.
"The secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service."
"Later, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration’s account of Tillerson’s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP."
Goldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.
"While many are happy that Tillerson is gone, many of us are concerned with Mike Pompeo being installed at Secretary of State, especially regarding his un-American comments against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who exposed the criminal activity of the Deep State in DC."
"Speaking of Snowden, he decided to chime in on the newly appointed CIA director, but did not say anything about Pompeo becoming Secretary of State."
“The new CIA director was a key part of the torture program and its illegal cover-up.
Her name was on the Top Secret order demanding the destruction of tapes to prevent them being seen by Congress.
Incredible.” Snowden tweeted.

Did Oakland Mayor Tip Off La Raza to ICE Raid?
"Schaaf refuses to say how she learned about the ICE raids, only saying it was not from official sources."
"“I felt that it was my duty to share the information,” Schaaf said."
"In emails we obtained through a public records request, we didn’t find out who her sources were, but we do know who she was talking to before she made her big announcement."
"Emails reveal that hours before the announcement, a group called Centro Legal de la Raza sent the mayor information on what employers should do in case of an ICE raid."
"Hours before the public was warned about ICE raids, some Oakland businesses got a head start, thanks to the mayor."
"According to emails, the Oakland Indie Alliance, a group of independent businesses, got a message saying “Important Alert!"
Credible information ICE Raids in Oakland Sunday 2/25 and Monday 2/26” and “This information comes directly from the Mayor.”
Now that last part is significant.
Any business that tips off illegal aliens admits that it is aware of their status.
"By passing along the warning, Mayor Schaaf was tipping off criminals committing a felony."
MS-503 Gang Member Apprehended by Border Patrol Agents In Arizona

"After agents interviewed the subject, it was determined that the 20-year-old El Salvadoran national was illegally in the United States."
He was arrested and transported to Yuma Station.
Agents positively identified the subject as Jose Rodriguez-Lopez and noted a MS-503 Gang tattoo across his chest.
Rodriguez-Lopez had no record of any criminal or immigration arrests in the United States.
He was processed for immigration violations.
Rep. Danny Davis was For/Against/For/Against Farrakhan
Rep. Danny Davis helped get the ball rolling by praising Farrakhan.
Then Rep. Davis' office issued a statement disavowing Farrakhan.
And then Davis got right back to talking to the Daily Caller and disavowed the disavowal.
"“The congressman was insistent that The Daily Caller misquoted him during the interview and that he didn’t subscribe to Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements and actions in the past,” the ADL official told JTA in a statement."
"“He expressed an interest in seeing some of the latest statements made by Farrakhan vis-a-vis Jews, which we promptly shared with him.” The congressman wasn’t sure why the ADL wrote that he had been misquoted in his praise for the anti-Semite, and said he wasn’t sure if someone from his office had told the ADL he was misquoted, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation on Sunday."
“I think that was what they wanted to write.
"Nah, I don’t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don’t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,” Davis said."
“That’s just one segment of what goes on in our world.
"For those heavy into it, that’s their thing, but it ain’t my thing,” he said"
"The term ""Jewish Question"" is largely used by anti-Semites."
So Davis then sorta disavowed his own statements.
J Street endorsed him.
And then he talked to the Daily Caller again.
Progress!
But that's Rep. Davis' current views.
He likes a racist hate group.
"Whoever the JTA has on the ""explain away Farrakhan's Dem fandom"" beat is going to be busy again."
Democrats like Oakland's Mayor Schaaf.
"Three illegal immigrants, who avoided capture after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf blew the whistle on a raid by federal immigration authorities last month, have since been re-arrested for new crimes including robbery and spousal abuse, ICE officials said."
"Schaaf tweeted out a warning ahead of the raid in northern California last month, infuriating Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and the Trump administration."
"But on Tuesday, officials said that at least three of those who were targeted in the raid, but were not apprehended, had since been arrested for additional crimes."
"One was a Mexican national arrested for robbery and gun crimes, who was released back into the community for a prior offense despite an ICE detainer request in November."
"Another Mexican national was arrested for a DUI, despite having been deported three times and prior convictions for false imprisonment, DUI and battery of a spouse."
"The third was a Mexican national who was arrested for corporal injury of a spouse, despite being deported twice and criminal convictions including drug possession, hit-and-run, DUIs, possessions of narcotics equipment and a parole violation."
Travis Air Force Base terrorist identified as Muslim Hafiz Kazi
Earlier today I wrote: “FBI spokeswoman Gina Swankie and Travis spokesman Airman Christian Conrad declined to elaborate on the matter or identify the driver.
Why?”
Now it’s clear why.
"“Man whose vehicle exploded at Travis AFB identified,” KGO, March 23, 2018:"
"TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (KGO) — A man who drove into Travis AFB has been identified as 51-year-old Hafiz Kazi, two sources with knowledge of the probe tell ABC News."
Authorities extracted a video from his cell phone and are analyzing it to try and see if it could help point to a motive.
Sources wouldn’t offer any details about the video.
The FBI is holding a press conference Friday at 3:30 p.m. and will be asking the public for help and any information about Kazi.
"Sources say the information gathered so far still does not point to a concrete motive, with one source calling the man a “mystery” still."
"Terrorism, mental health issues, and everything else are still on the table as authorities try to uncover a motive."
"On Wednesday, the car crashed at the main gate of Travis Air Force Base."
Officials are treating it as a possible attempted attack.
The FBI is now leading the investigation.
"“The car basically blew up,” said witness Kamren Hernandez."
"Hernandez’ father, Lamar, saw it too."
Kept on going.” Travis Air Force Base officials are investigating a security incident that occurred at the main gate on Wednesday….
"A U.S. official tells ABC News it appears the driver had propane tanks in the vehicle, which they may have ignited deliberately…."
Article posted with permission from Pamela Geller
"“We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point,” Ragan said."
"That means they didn’t find an ISIS membership card in his wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, “I did this for Allah and Islam."
"We know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself."
"Even if he wasn’t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad."
"The FBI’s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption."
"The FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism."
"It doesn’t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others."
"So, each time something like this happens, they’re back at Square One, trying to figure out motive."
"“Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base,” by Phil Willon, Los Angeles Times, March 23, 2018:"
Federal investigators on Friday said that the person who drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California was a 51-year-old Bay Area man originally from India.
"Hafiz Kazi was a legal permanent resident and had lived in the United States since 1993, said Sean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office."
"Kazi had lived in the Bay Area, including Sausalito, Ragan said, but his most recent place of residence was not known."
Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the Wednesday night attack or evidence that anyone else was involved.
"“We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point,” Ragan said, adding that aspect of the case was still being investigated."
"“Now the question is, why."
Why was he there?
What led him there?
"And we don’t know answers to that, quite frankly.” Kazi drove the Kia minivan through the front gate of the military base, which is near Fairfield, around 7 p.m. Wednesday."
"Security personnel saw flames inside the van, which crashed shortly after going through the gate, Ragan said."
Emergency responders initially did not know if it was an attack or some sort of mishap.
"But when they opened the doors to the minivan they found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said…."
"The dead man’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of “jihad” video was found on Kazi’s phone…."

Western Michigan ICE operation nets 16 arrests over 4-day period
"KALAMAZOO, Mich. – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) deportation officers arrested 16 individuals for violating federal immigration laws in western Michigan during a four-day targeted enforcement operation that ended Thursday."
Nine of the immigration violators arrested during the operation were convicted criminals.
Two individuals illegally re-entered the country after deportation.
"Depending on the alien’s criminal history, an alien who illegally reenters the United States, after having been previously removed, has committed a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison."
Fourteen men and two women were arrested during the enforcement actions.
"With the exception of a Congolese man, all of those arrested were nationals of Mexico."
"Enforcement activities took place primarily in Berrien, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, and Van Buren counties."
"Criminal convictions of those arrested include but are not limited to domestic violence, DUI, operating while intoxicated, illegal entry, aggravated assault, assault and battery and carrying a concealed weapon."
The arrests include:
· A 19-year-old male Mexican national with a prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.
"· A 46-year-old male national of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with convictions for aggravated assault, resisting arrest, and other charges."
"· A 36-year-old male Mexican national with convictions for assault and battery, aggravated assault, and other offenses."
· A 56-year-old female Mexican national with a federal conviction for illegal entry.
She is facing federal re-entry after deportation charges.
All four remain in agency custody.
The arrestees who are not being federally prosecuted will be processed administratively for removal from the United States.
"Those who have outstanding orders of removal, or who returned to the United States illegally after being deported, are subject to immediate removal from the country."
"The remaining individuals are in ICE custody awaiting a hearing before an immigration judge, or pending travel arrangements for removal in the near future."
FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base
"“Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base” was the Los Angeles Times headline, and this one is indeed a real mystery."
"A Muslim named Hafiz Kazi, according to the Times, “drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.” After scrutinizing all the evidence closely, the FBI just can’t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi’s motive."
And that in a nutshell shows what’s wrong with today’s FBI.
"Sean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office, stated: “We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point."
"Now the question is, why."
Why was he there?
What led him there?
"And we don’t know answers to that, quite frankly.”"
"The Times noted that when emergency responders approached the burning van after it crashed, “they found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said.”"
"Yes, what Kazi could possibly have been up to is a complete mystery."
"The Times added that “the dead man’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of ‘jihad’ video was found on Kazi’s phone.”"
All right.
No jihad video.
"And no “nexus of terrorism,” according to Sean Ragan."
What is a nexus of terrorism?
"Of course, even if they had found those things, given the FBI’s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi’s motive."
"In any case, a larger point is being lost here."
And that is that there is a war going on.
"We know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself."
"Even if he wasn’t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad."
Authorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues.

"Awan removed the stepmother, Samina Gilani, as the longstanding beneficiary of the policy and replaced her with himself around the period of his father’s death, according to legal and insurance papers."
"The stepmother, Samina Gilani, also claimed in 2017 that Abid’s brother Imran Awan held her in “captivity” and wiretapped and extorted her, weeks after the House Office of Inspector General separately alleged that they made “unauthorized access” to congressmen’s data."

The Daily Caller News Foundation was present at the court hearing.
Associates and relatives have long accused the family of green.
"(Syed Ahmed knew Abid well enough to loan him money, according to bankruptcy documents filed by Abid.)"
"The FBI arrested Imran, the eldest of the three Awan brothers, at Dulles Airport trying to fly to Pakistan in July, and prosecutors charged him with fraudulently gathering money the prior winter to wire overseas, possibly in an attempt to flee the investigation into the family’s activities involving House computers."
"“Based on the suspicious timing of that transaction, Awan and [wife Hina] Alvi likely knew they were under investigation at that time” and “there are strong indications of flight in this case,” prosecutors wrote."
Abid was making his own efforts to round up money at the same time via the life insurance policy.
Abid then used those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.
"When his father died on Jan. 16, 2017, the youngest Awan brother, Jamal, attested on the death certificate provided to the insurance company that his father was divorced, a statement Gilani’s lawyer said would have kept her from the money."
A Virginia court later ruled that Jamal’s statement about his marital status on the certificate was wrong.
"On Dec. 12, 2016, Imran and Alvi – who was also on the House payroll – began taking a series of withdrawals from banks, some of which federal prosecutors say occurred under fraudulent pretenses."
"In January 2017, Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan."
"Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan Jan. 18, according to the indictment."
"On Jan. 17, Abid filed notarized papers using those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary."
The life insurance change’s timing seems to coincide with other moves by Abid to liquidate property and transfer it.
"Ten weeks prior, on Nov. 1, 2016, Alvi sold a house to Jamal for $620,000, netting another significant profit from the mortgage company."
"In addition to his primary residence, Abid owned the house where his mother and stepfather lived, and moved in after his death, with Gilani becoming homeless."
Abid owned two homes despite a $1 million 2012 bankruptcy that might ordinarily have forced him to sell the second home to pay creditors.
"At that time, he filed forms “under penalty of perjury” that two houses were needed as “my spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purposes of evading the requirements.”"
"However, his wife, Ukrainian-born Nataliia Sova – who also was on the House payroll – signed as a witness on the 2016 life insurance form as “spouse of Abid,” and they have been photographed living together."
"Gilani told TheDCNF the brothers were trying to use the life insurance policy as leverage to persuade her to sign a power of attorney giving them access to “assets of my late husband in Pakistan,” which were much more valuable than the $50,000 policy."
"Gilani alleged the brothers took her financial documents, a laptop, and her husband’s possessions."
"The only lawyer she could afford, she claimed, was Michael Hadeed, a business attorney who was convicted in 2010 of conspiracy and immigration fraud for helping aliens obtain green cards by setting them up with fake employment relationships."
"He lost his bar license for two years, according to Virginia State Bar documents."
Hadeed withdrew earlier allegations of fraud and asked the judge to try the case based solely on interpretation of contract language.
"After court, Hadeed told reporters Bacon had threatened to sue him for defamation."
"“I don’t want to subject myself to that,” he said outside court."
“I don’t want to get myself in a lawsuit over this.”
"In court, Bacon badgered Hadeed."
“Are you going to share any more info with them?
I hope not.
"I hope you learned that lesson,” he said."
"Hadeed said three different signatures from Abid on financial documents did not match, and put a defiant Abid on the witness stand."
Hadeed: You were aware you were changing beneficiary from your father’s spouse to yourself?
Abid: That was my father’s request…
Hadeed: You’re not answering the question.
"Abid: I’m not very smart, so it takes a while sometimes…"
Your job is to answer the question.
"In court documents, Gilani alleged, “while he was admitted in hospital my telephone conversations were taped and some other recording devices were also installed/planted in my house … Imran Awan showed up and threatened me for me calling the police."
"Based on Hadeed’s narrow legal argument about the life insurance contract’s language, the judge ruled that, “The son as the owner of the policy has the absolute right to change the beneficiary.”"
"After Gilani retained a lawyer, Bacon had offered a settlement where they’d split the money, but Gilani declined it."
"The court awarded Abid the $50,000 life insurance payout, minus $5,000 that the insurance company took for its expenses in litigating the fraud allegations."
“You should have taken the settlement.
"Now she’s not getting a penny,” Bacon said in court."
“You’re not getting anything.”
Gilani said after court that her conscience didn’t allow her to settle.
“I didn’t do the deal because they had been adopting bad behaviors.
I cannot agree to that.
"It wasn’t about the money,” she said."

Two cases of Ebola confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
"Two cases of Ebola have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to a government health official."
"Jean Jack Muyembe, head of the national institute for biological research, said that at least ten more cases were also suspected in the northwestern town of Bikoro."
"Local health officials in Democratic Republic of Congo reported 21 patients showing signs of hemorrhagic fever and 17 deaths in the affected area before an Ebola outbreak was confirmed on Tuesday, the health ministry said."
"Medical teams have taken five samples from suspected active cases and two tested positive for the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, the ministry said in a statement."
It is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in the DRC.
"Last year, eight people were infected and four people died after an outbreak of the disease."
The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.
"It is believed to be spread over long distances by bats, which can host the virus without dying."
These animals then infect other tree-dwelling creatures such as monkeys.
Ebola can often spread to humans from infected bushmeat.
Image: Ebola is a difficult illness to contain and efforts to stop it spreading are vital
"The World Health Organisation reports that the first Ebola outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests."
The two-year outbreak in West Africa that began in 2014 involved major urban areas as well as rural ones.
"More than 11,300 people died and some 28,600 were infected, most of them in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia."
"Sporadic cases of Ebola have occurred since the epidemic was brought under control, with a small number of patients being confirmed in 2017."
"The disease was first detected in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in what is now Nzara, South Sudan, and the other in Yambuku in the DRC."
"The latter occurred near the River Ebola, after which the disease is named."
Ebola outbreak declared in Democratic Republic of Congo
"Story highlights Two cases were confirmed, prompting the outbreak declaration"
"In the past five weeks, there have been 21 suspected cases, including 17 deaths"
The declaration came after laboratory results confirmed two cases of the disease in the province of Bikoro in the northwestern part of the country.
"Ebola virus disease, which most commonly affects people and nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees), is caused by one of five Ebola viruses."
The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.
The average case fatality rate is around 50%.
"A government statement released Tuesday states that the Ministry of Health has ""taken all necessary measures to respond promptly and effectively to this new epidemic of Ebola in the DRC's national territory""."
"In the past five weeks, there have been 21 suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fever , including 17 deaths."
"""We will gather more samples, conduct contact tracing, engage the communities with messages on prevention and control, and put in place methods for improving data collection and sharing,"" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa."
"""WHO will work closely with health authorities and partners to support the national response."""

New outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in northwest DR Congo
"""Twenty-one cases of fever with haemorrhagic indications and 17 deaths"" have been recorded in Equateur province, it said, citing a notification to the ministry as of May 3."
"It is the DRC's ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976, when the deady viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team."
"In Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) said lab tests in the DRC confirmed the presence of Ebola virus in two out of five samples collected from patients."
"""WHO is working closely with the government of the DRC to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners, using the model of a successful response to a similar... outbreak in 2017,"" it said in a statement."
"It said it had released $1 million (840,000 euros) from an emergency contingency fund, set up a coordination group and deployed more than 50 experts to work with the DRC government and health agencies."
"""The action plan prepared by the health ministry has been approved,"" an official statement released after a cabinet meeting said."
- No new deaths -
"""Since the notification of the cases on May 3, no deaths have been reported,"" it said, without specifying when the first case came to light."
"The outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba."
"All the cases were reported from a clinic at Ilkoko Iponge, located about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Bikoro, where treatment capacities are limited, the WHO said."
"A team of experts from the WHO, Doctors without Borders (DRC) and Equateur province travelled to Bikoro on Tuesday to beef up coordination and carry out investigations, it said."
"It is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for ""bushmeat""."
The virus is handed on by contact with bodily fluids -- touching a sick or dead person is a well-known source of infection.
"Following an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat."
"That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding."
"The worst-ever Ebola outbreak started in December 2013 in southern Guinea before spreading to two neighbouring west African countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone."
"That outbreak killed more than 11,300 people out of nearly 29,000 registered cases, according to WHO estimates, although the real figure is thought to be significantly higher."
"More than 99 percent of victims were in the three West African countries, although cases occurred in other parts of the world, often stirring panic."
"There is no current vaccine to prevent Ebola or licensed treatment for it, although a range of experimental drugs are in development."
Early care with rehydration may boost the chance of survival.
"Given the lack of a pharmaceutical weapon against Ebola, health experts have responded with time-honoured measures of control, prevention and containment."
"They use rigorous protocols to protect medical personnel with disposable full-body suits, masks, goggles and gloves and disinfecting sprays."
Ebola Outbreak Confirmed in Democratic Republic of Congo

"According to the country's Health Ministry, five samples were taken from suspected cases in Bikoro."
"Out of the five samples sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, two tested positive for Ebola."
"However, no deaths have been reported among those with the disease."
"""We will gather more samples, conduct contact tracing, engage the communities with messages on prevention and control and put in place methods for improving data collection and sharing,"" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's (WHO) regional director for Africa, following the outbreak announcement."
"""WHO will work closely with health authorities and partners to support the national response,"" Moeti added."
This is the Congo's ninth outbreak of the virus since it was discovered in the country in 1976.
The last outbreak occurred in the northern Bas Uele province in 2017.
"However, it was quickly contained due to swift action taken by the government and the WHO."
"Congo confirms 2 Ebola cases, declares outbreak"
"KINSHASA, Congo -- Congo's government on Tuesday declared a new outbreak of Ebola in the country's rural northwest, after two cases of the deadly virus were confirmed in Bikoro."
"Congo's Health Ministry said that of five samples sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, two were positive for the Zaire strain of Ebola in the country's Equateur province."
"The samples were gathered after the Equateur province Health Ministry notified Kinshasa on May 3 of some 21 cases of a hemorrhagic fever in the Ikoko Impenge area, including 17 deaths, according to the World Health Organization and Congo's government."
There are various hemorrhagic fevers.
A team was sent by the WHO and Doctors Without Borders over the weekend to investigate and strengthen coordination.
"The five new cases were then identified and sent to the laboratory, Congo's government said."
"Since that time, no deaths have been reported among those hospitalized or among health workers treating the ill, it said."
"A team of experts will go to Bikoro today to implement measures to avoid further spread of the disease, said the ministry statement."
"The team also will investigate how the outbreak first started, it said."
"This is the ninth Ebola outbreak in Congo since 1976, when the disease was first identified."
"Congo has a long track record with Ebola, the World Health Organization said."
The most recent outbreak was in May 2017 and killed four of the eight people infected in Congo's Bas-Uele province in the northeast.
That outbreak was quickly contained and was declared over in July.
"None of these outbreaks was connected to the outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone that began in 2014 and left more than 11,300 people dead."
"Ebola occasionally jumps to humans from animals, including bats and monkeys."
"Without preventive measures, the virus can spread quickly between people and is fatal in up to 90 percent of cases."
"There is no specific treatment for Ebola, which is spread through the bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms."
"A new experimental vaccine has been shown to be effective against the virus, though quantities are currently limited."
WHO said Tuesday that it is working closely with Congo's government to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners as it did successfully in Congo last year.
"""Our top priority is to get to Bikoro to work alongside the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and partners to reduce the loss of life and suffering related to this new Ebola virus disease outbreak,"" said Dr. Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response."
"""Working with partners and responding early and in a coordinated way will be vital to containing this deadly disease."""

DRC: Fresh Ebola outbreak kills two in Equateur Province
"The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that it was taking steps to help deal with a new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo's rural northwest, after two cases of the deadly virus were confirmed in the market town of Bikoro."
"Congo's Health Ministry said two of the five samples it sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, came back positive for the disease."
"The samples were gathered after health officials in Equateur Province notified Kinshasa on May 3 of about 21 cases of a hemorrhagic fever in the Ikoko Impenge area, including 17 deaths, according to WHO and Congo's government."
What is Ebola?
"Rare but deadly, the viral disease is most commonly affecting primates and humans."
"Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, joint and muscle aches, weakness, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain lack of appetite and in some cases internal and external bleeding, according to WHO."
Where did it originate from?
Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks.
One in what is now Nzara in South Sudan.
The other outbreak in Yambuku in Zaire in what is now DR Congo.
"The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name."
Why is it so dangerous?
The average Ebola fatality rate is about 50 percent.
But the rates have varied from 25 percent to 90 percent in recent outbreaks.
"There is as of yet no proven cure available for Ebola, though some vaccines are being tested."
"Some people who have recovered from Ebola have developed long-term complications, such as joint and vision problems."
It is not known why some people recover from Ebola while most succumb to the disease.
Why does it keep coming back?
"The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope."
"In Africa where most outbreaks happen, particular species of fruit bats are considered natural hosts for the Ebola virus."
"Infected bats are believed to transmit the disease to humans, or indirectly through other animals that are hunted for their meat."
"The family of the first victim of the 2014 outbreak, a two-year-old child, hunted bats and it is believed bushmeat was the origin of the outbreak."
"An estimated five million tonnes of bushmeat is consumed on the continent every year, according to the Centre for International Forestry Research."
"The virus then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments."
The latest Ebola outbreak in DR Congo has left 17 dead
© Provided by Quartz
The Democratic Republic Congo is facing the familiar challenge of containing yet another Ebola outbreak.
"Since confirming the outbreak on Tuesday (May 8), DR Congo’s health ministry now says 17 people have died in Bikoro, a town in the northwest Equateur province."
It’s the ninth Ebola outbreak in DR Congo since the virus which causes hemorrhagic fever was discovered in the country in 1976.
The most recent outbreak came in May 2017 and killed four people before it was contained.
"The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo #DRC declared a new outbreak of #Ebola in Bikoro, Equateur province today."
Laboratory results confirmed two cases.
"— WHO (@WHO) May 8, 2018"
The outbreak has prompted urgent action from the World Health Organization (WHO) which has dispatched a team to the country and has released $1 million to support response efforts to stop the virus from spreading.
Ebola is transmitted among people through human contact and has a case fatality rate of 50%.
Health officials will wait to record two 21-day incubation cycles of the virus without any new cases before declaring the outbreak over.
"Depending on the scale of the new outbreak the health ministry might turn to rVSV-ZEBOV, an experimental vaccine which showed signs of promise during testing."
"Despite its repeated outbreaks however, DR Congo typically records low fatalities thanks to experienced medical staff and public awareness campaigns."
"As outbreaks typically occur in remote villages, they have also been easier to contain."
"The dangers of a wider outbreak were apparent in 2014 when an Ebola epidemic hit West Africa with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone the worst affected nations."

Leaked Doc Reveals White House Planning “Regime Change” In Iran
This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
It appears Rudy Giuliani wasn’t lying.
"The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including – who else – National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009, writes the Free Beacon, which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans."
"The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton—a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change—entered the White House."
"It deemphasizes U.S military intervention, instead focusing on a series of moves to embolden an Iranian population that has increasingly grown angry at the ruling regime for its heavy investments in military adventurism across the region."
–Free Beacon
"“The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,” SSG writes in the paper."
“This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months” it further claims as an argument to push a “regime change” policy.
"For now – at least – overthrowing the Iran government, with its extensive and close ties to the Kremlin, is not official US policy; SSG president Jim Hanson told the Free Beacon that the Trump administration does not want to engage in direct military intervention in Iran – and is instead focusing on other methods of ridding Iran of its “hardline ruling regime.”"
"“The Trump administration has no desire to roll tanks in an effort to directly topple the Iranian regime,” Hanson said."
“But they would be much happier dealing with a post-Mullah government.
That is the most likely path to a nuclear weapons-free and less dangerous Iran.”
"One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change"
"“The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,” said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue."
"“Prior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism."
"It’s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place.”"
The source tells the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”
"“John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior—and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially—until that revolutionary regime is gone,” the source said, adding that “nothing’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.”"
"That said, Bolton is confident that an Iranian regime change will occur in the next six months:"
"John Bolton – We Will Be Celebrating in Tehran Before 2019 >You can’t say you weren’t warned pic.twitter.com/F1dvZAVQaF — Battle Beagle 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 (@HarmlessYardDog) May 7, 2018"
"“Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem."
President Trump hired him knowing all of that.
"Regional sources who have spoken to SSG “tell us that Iranian social media is more outraged about internal oppression, such as the recent restrictions on Telegram, than about supporting or opposing the nuclear program."
"Iranian regime oppression of its ethnic and religious minorities has created the conditions for an effective campaign designed to splinter the Iranian state into component parts,” the group states."
–Free Beacon
"“More than one third of Iran’s population is minority groups, many of whom already seek independence,” the paper explains."
“U.S.
"support for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.”"
"Without a regime change, the United States will continue face threats from Iranian forces stationed throughout the region, including in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon."
"“The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,” the plan states."
"“Any public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,” according to the plan."
“We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.”
WATCH: John Bolton Promises Room Full of ‘Former Terrorists’ the US Would ‘Overthrow’ Iran by 2019
"For those who may not be paying attention, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works."
"In fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009 for this very purpose."
MEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime.
They are hardly quiet about it.
"According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009."

"The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself."
"And that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”"
"Well, the entire event was actually put on by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK."
"As Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism."
"For decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians."
"To those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report."
"This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense."
"“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said."
"“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”"
All presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.
Now it’s Trump’s turn.

Here We Go Again - Leaked Documents: White House Planning Regime Change In Iran
"Apparently, the US didn't learn from its first dealings in regime change decades ago and is now prepared to give it another shot, according to leaked documents."
Don't get me wrong here.
I'm not for the government of Iran.
"Overall, the people of Iran are probably some decent people, but those in leadership have issues, but that is something for the people there to deal with."
Iran is not an actual threat to the united States.

The Washington Free Beacon reports:
"The Trump administration is examining a new plan to help Iranians fighting the hardline regime in Iran following America's exit from the landmark nuclear deal and reimposition of harsh economic sanctions that could topple a regime already beset by protests and a crashing economy, according to a copy of the plan obtained by the Washington Free Beacon."
The three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime.
"The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009."
"The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton—a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change—entered the White House."
"Ah, yes, John Bolton."
"While I applaud Bolton for his willingness to call Islamic jihadis just that, I am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations has no effect in this decision."
"""The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,"" SSG writes in the paper."
"""This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months."""
"Well, why is that?"
It's due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US.
"As has been pointed out before, sanctions hurt the people, not the governments that lead them and then those same governments use the effects to propagandize the people against those who are ordering the sanctions."
"I'm not saying the Iranian government is good, but it is Iran's government."
"Honestly, I see a ton of corruption and warmongering in our own government that rivals some of that of governments that America stands against."
"Still, as was pointed out by Matt Agorist, Bolton told an audience of the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran:"
"“There is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today."
"I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs’ regime in Tehran."
"And that’s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!”"
"And again, this really has nothing to do with the US."
"One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change."
"“The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,” said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue."
"“Prior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism."
"It’s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place.”"
The source told the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”
"“John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior—and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially—until that revolutionary regime is gone,” the source said, adding that “nothing’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.”"
"OK, I get they may pose a danger, but let's look at the reality here."
"Those they pose a danger to, namely Saudi Arabia and Israel can both fend perfectly well for themselves and have demonstrated that ability to do it."
There is no need for the US to be involved in it in any way.
"Why should we be fighting a battle or encouraging, funding, and I'm quite sure arming, a rebellion?"
Simple.
It isn't.
I care little for the Saudi government as they help push Sharia and is the land where many of the 9-11 hijackers came from.
"The Iranian government I care for even less, but out of each of those, which one should America have dealt with militarily following 9-11?"
"Both, if you're going to go by information that we have a record on."
Why can't America focus on it's own issues and solve those?
"It's because we are too busy trying to police the world, keeping the spotlight off of those in our government who are attacking our rights and spending us into more and more debt."
And lest you think this is about the nuclear deal.
It isn't.
"“The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it’s the Iranian regime,” the source told the Beacon."
"“Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem."
President Trump hired him knowing all of that.
Bolton says it will be accomplished in the next six months.
Notice some things that are taking place in Iran that the plan speaks about.
"“More than one third of Iran’s population is minority groups, many of whom already seek independence,” the paper explains."
“U.S.
"support for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.”"
"“The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,” the plan states."
President Trump did made clear earlier in the week that we must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime.
"Well, I agree, but that gets real messy when you start intervening in this manner."
"“Any public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,” according to the plan."
“We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.”
But the Trump administration has spoken out on other countries where the people want their independence.
Remember the Kurds?
How about the people in the Catalan region of Spain?
"No support for those people, and why?"
Cause it's not part of the agenda.
"I say if the Iranian people want their freedom, let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam, and then let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the Holy Scriptures and stand and fight."
"Then, they will be in a position to ask for aid, but only then."
Trump’s Plan for Iran: Put Terrorists in Charge?
"Back in the 2008 presidential race, I explained to then-candidate Rudy Giuliani the concept of “blowback.” Years of US meddling and military occupation of parts of the Middle East motivated a group of terrorists to carry out attacks against the United States on 9/11."
"They didn’t do it because we are so rich and so free, as the neocons would have us believe."
They came over here because we had been killing Muslims “over there” for decades.
How do we know this?
"Well, they told us."
Osama bin Laden made it clear why al-Qaeda sought to attack the US.
They didn’t like the US taking sides in the Israel-Palestine conflict and they didn’t like US troops on their holy land.
"Why believe a terrorist, some responded."
"As I explained to Giuliani ten years ago, the concept of “blowback” is well-known in the US intelligence community and particularly by the CIA."

"Unfortunately, it is clear that Giuliani never really understood what I was trying to tell him."
"Like the rest of the neocons, he either doesn’t get it or doesn’t want to get it."
Giuliani shares with numerous other neocons like John Bolton a strong relationship with this group.
"In fact, both Giuliani and Bolton have been on the payroll of the MeK and have received tens of thousands of dollars to speak to their followers."
This is another example of how foreign lobbies and special interest groups maintain an iron grip on our foreign policy.
It’s easy to dismiss the bombastic Giuliani as he speaks to his financial benefactors in the MeK.
"Unfortunately, however, Giuliani’s claims were confirmed late last week, when the Washington Free Beacon published a three-page policy paper being circulated among National Security Council officials containing plans to spark regime change in Iran."
The paper suggests that the US focus on Iran’s many ethnic minority groups to spark unrest and an eventual overthrow of the government.
"This is virtually the same road map that the US has followed in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and so on."
"We know from 9/11 that blowback is real, even if Giuliani and the neocons refuse to understand it."
Iran does not threaten the United States.
"Unlike Washington’s Arab allies in the region, Iran actually holds reasonably democratic elections and has a Western-oriented, educated, and very young population."
Why not open up to Iran with massive amounts of trade and other contacts?
Does anyone (except for the neocons) really believe it is better to unleash terrorists on a population than to engage them in trade and travel?

WHO Prepares For “Worst Case” As Congo Ebola Outbreak Spreads
This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
"In the week since we first noted the new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the number of cases has risen by 50%, and The World Health Organization has now said it is preparing for “the worst case scenario.”"
"The WHO has tallied 32 suspected or confirmed cases in the northwestern area of Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumbathe near the border with the Republic of Congo, including 18 deaths, between April 4 and May 9."
"The outbreak, declared by the DRC health ministry on Tuesday, is the DRC’s ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976,when the deadly viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team."
Scientists are greatly concerned that this outbreak in the remote Bikoro region will travel 175 miles to the city of Mbandaka – the capital of Equateur province and home to around 1.2 million residents.
We’ve updated this map.
"Turns out that the provincial capital of Equateur, Mbandaka, is home to roughly 1M people."
It’s less than 300 km or 175 miles from Bikoro and reachable by water.
"pic.twitter.com/3Q3PwAAdsh — Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) May 11, 2018"
What’s worrisome is that the most recent WHO update says that there are two probable cases at Wangata – which is very close to Mbandaka.
#EbolaDRC: This news gives me pause.
"@WHO‘s latest update says there are 2 probable cases at Wangata, which is adjacent to the provincial capital, Mbandaka."
Population of Mbandaka = 1.2 million.
"https://t.co/LwlMGcAL7J pic.twitter.com/RVVO15m2F9 — Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) May 14, 2018"
"Peter Salma, head of emergency response at the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week: “If we see a town of that size infected with Ebola, then we are going to have a major urban outbreak,” adding “We are very concerned, and we are planning for all scenarios, including the worst-case scenario.”"
Today I had the chance to see first-hand the #Ebola response in #DRC.
Teams are motivated and working hard.
"I visited the hospital in Bikoro where patients are being treated, and lab technicians are testing samples."
We’re working with our partners 24/7 to stop this outbreak.
"pic.twitter.com/JzYH3snmjM — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) May 13, 2018"
"The WHO is planning to send up to 40 specialists to the affected area over the next week or so, while Salma adds that the UN hopes to have a mobile lab up and running this weekend, similar to the one set up by the WHO."
"The WHO and World Food Programme are also working to set up an ‘air-bridge’ to help bring in supplies, however, only helicopters can be used until an airfield is cleared to allow larger planes to land, Mr Salama added."
"The health body has released £738,000 ($1m) from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to support response activities for the next three months."
–Daily Mail
"Mobile lab materials being shipped to strength rapid analysis of the samples from Bikoro, the #Ebola affected area in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, #DRC 🇨🇩 pic.twitter.com/vgmyqWhLFV — WHO African Region (@WHOAFRO) May 12, 2018"
"Over 100 Red Cross volunteers in #Equateur province (50 in #Mbandaka, 60 in #Bikoro) now mobilized to fight the spread of #Ebola in #DRCongo."
"Community volunteers and groups are critical to stopping the spread of diseases, especially in isolated areas."
"pic.twitter.com/oJ33Dn1CFB — IFRC Africa (@IFRCAfrica) May 13, 2018"
This marks the country’s ninth epidemic since the ebola virus was identified in 1976.
"When a small outbreak hit the DRC last year, eight people were infected and four died."
"In 2014, 66 were infected out of which 49 died – a 74% fatality rate."
"In the 2002-2003 outbreak, 90% of those infected died."
"That said, on average the disease kills around half of those who contract it."
"The pandemic was officially declared over back in January 2016, when Liberia was announced to be Ebola-free by the WHO."
"The country, rocked by back-to-back civil wars that ended in 2003, was hit the hardest by the fever, with 40 per cent of the deaths having occurred there."
"Sierra Leone reported the highest number of Ebola cases, with nearly of all those infected having been residents of the nation."
-Daily Mail
"Experts say the DRC’s vast, remote terrain provides an advantage, as outbreaks often remain localized and easy to isolate."
"Bikoro, however, is not far from the Congo river – an essential waterway used for transport and commerce."
Downstream lies Kinshasa and Brazzaville – the DRC’s capital.
The two cities are home to a combined 12 million people.
"As such, neighboring countries are on high alert."
"Officials in Nigeria, Guinea and Gambia have incresaed screening measures along their airports and borders, measures which helped contain the virus during the West African epidemic that began in 2013."
"Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi and the Republic of Congo – which border the DRC – have all been alerted."
"While Kenya, which does not border the country, has issued warnings over the possible spread of Ebola."
Thermal guns to detect anyone with a fever have been put in place along its border with Uganda and at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.
"Concerned health officials in Nigeria, which also does not border the DRC, have put similar measures in place to keep its population safe."
-Daily Mail
"Scientists believe Ebola is most often passed to humans by fruit bats, however porcupines, gorillas, antelope and chimpanzees could also be carriers."
"It is transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids (and surfaces) of those infected."
"There is currently no “proven” treatment for Ebola, however dozens of experimental drugs exist – including a vaccine called rVSV-ZEBOV, which has reportedly protected nearly 6,000 people."
This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
"The BBC reports that Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed a case in Mbandaka, a city of a million people about 130km (80 miles) from the area where the first cases were confirmed earlier this month."
The city is a major transportation hub with routes to the capital Kinshasa.
Forty-four people have been infected and 23 people are known to have died.
"“This is a major development in the outbreak,” he told the BBC."
"“We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola."
"“This puts a whole different lens on this outbreak and gives us increased urgency to move very quickly into Mbandaka to stop this new first sign of transmission,” he said."
"The BBC adds that the WHO said it was not recommending any trade or travel restrictions either within DR Congo, for example between Mbandaka and Kinshasa, or internationally."
But Mr Salama said that 13 countries in the region were boosting border screening measures and said DR Congo itself was increasing exit screening measures.
"“The good news is that the DR Congo population is very used to Ebola outbreaks,” he added."
“They know to protect themselves by avoiding mass gatherings and mass funerals.
They know as well that traditional healers can amplify the outbreak.”
"As The Daily Mail notes, it is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in Congo since the disease made its first known appearance near its northern Ebola river in the 1970s."
Ebola is most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in victims owing to damage done to blood vessels.
"The Mail reports that health workers have recorded confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in three health zones of Congo’s Equateur province, and have identified 432 people who may have had contact with the disease, the WHO said."
Supplies sent to Congo included more than 300 body bags for safe burials in affected communities.
"The vaccine will be reserved for people suspected of coming into contact with the disease, as well as health workers."
"The vaccine requires storage at a temperature between -60 and -80 degrees C, tricky in a country with unreliable electricity."
West Virginia Middle School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah
"We see this again and again: schoolchildren have to make the Islamic profession of faith or affirm Islam as fact, in public schools."
"Then when administrators are confronted, they claim it was all just an educational exercise, not proselytizing."

"For some reason, this form of educational exercise is only ever used regarding Islam."
"Now, why is that?"
"“Christian Parent Furious After School Instructs Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah,” by Joshua Gill, Daily Caller News Foundation, May 17, 2018 (thanks to the Geller Report):"
"The packet, edited from the full version of a world religions workbook, instructed students to practice writing the Shahada, or Islamic profession of faith, in Arabic calligraphy — an assignment that, if left undone, would result in detention, according to Penkoski’s daughter."
“I saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic.
"Their excuse was calligraphy,” Penkoski told The Christian Post."
"“I was like, ‘Whoa!"
Whoa!
"Whoa!’ First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad."
"My daughter is not doing that.’ My daughter told me that if she didn’t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip,” Penkoski added…."
"There were two different calligraphy assignments — one involving the Shahada and another instructing students to practice writing English letters in calligraphy, Branch told Christian Post."
"Hinson “told the students that they could do these activities if they wanted,” Branch claimed."
“The teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another.
"She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents,” Branch added."
"Penkoski claimed the teacher sent students home with the same packet the day after he lodged a complaint — this time, with certain sections crossed out but still including the Shahada assignment."
Penkoksi called the principal again and confronted Hinson over the phone.
"“I said, ‘This is not OK in asking my kid to write down the Shahada.’ The teacher happened to walk-in and said she made it an option and that the kids didn’t have to do it."
"My daughter conflicted that story and said, ‘No, that is not what was said.’ What was said was, ‘Do the assignment; and if you want to learn more about the Quran, ask your parents,’” Penkoski told Christian Post."
"Each religion studied in the class, including Christianity and Judaism, received “equitable treatment,” Branch also told Christian Post."
"He said the class spent a week and a half on Christianity and Judaism — other religions took one week — and discussed each religion’s beliefs, history and practices."
"During the section on Christianity, “Jesus was taught,” Branch claimed."
"“The students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity’s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, and salvation."
"They also discussed the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper and Jesus’ Betrayal, the Trinity, and the Lord’s Prayer, among other topics,” Branch said."
"Penkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch’s claims."
"The Lord’s Prayer was not taught, and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus, they told Christian Post."
“We did [the unit on Christianity] over a week and two days.
We watched two different videos.
We didn’t finish them.
"They taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments, Peter and Paul,” Brielle explained."
“We learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans.
We were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus.” Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version.
"While the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran, the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements, he said."
"“Notice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord’s Prayer,” he said."
"“[There’s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet,” he added…."

The Islamization of the Public Schools
Muslims anxious to use schools and textbooks to proselytize for Islam have found a welcoming environment in American public schools that are indefatigably committed to multiculturalism.
Many of the Islamic groups that vet American public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on Islamic doctrine and history are Saudi-funded.

"We have seen this just recently, when Mountain Ridge Middle School in Gerrardstown, West Virginia instructed students to copy out the Islamic profession of faith (shahada), ostensibly as a calligraphy exercise."
Parent Rich Penkoski recounted: “I saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic.
Their excuse was calligraphy.
The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.
"I said, ‘That is not happening."
"My daughter is not doing that.’ My daughter told me that if she didn’t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip.”"
"Branch contradicted Penkoski, claiming: “The teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another."
"She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents.” He said that Christianity and Judaism were given “equitable treatment” in the same class."
"Penkoski’s daughter, Brielle, however, said that the class spent much less time on Christianity and Judaism than it did on Islam."
"Penkoski pointed out that the accompanying exercises were also less extensive for Christianity and Judaism than they were for Islam: “Notice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord’s Prayer."
[There’s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet.”
"The complaint adds: “Due to the fact that these doctrinal messages calling for conversion to Islam were included in video format with vivid images and text, they possess greater communicative impact and are more likely to be accepted by the students viewing them than information that is spoken in a classroom or even written in a book.”"
These accounts are not singular.
"High school students in Newton, Massachusetts in October 2017, according to Fox News, “pretended to be Muslims in the ‘Islamic’ city of Jerusalem as part of a class assignment.” The assignment also included a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel article."
"Meanwhile, Georgia parent Michelle King noted in 2016: “My daughter had to learn the Shahid and the Five Pillars of Islam, which is what you learn to convert,” while not teaching Christianity or the Ten Commandments."
"One homework assignment in Walton County, Georgia, stated: “Allah is the [blank] worshiped by Jews & Christians,” with students having to fill in the blank with “same God.”"
Indeed.
"“They are not going to learn any other religion, doctrines or creeds and they are not going back over this chapter."
"Even though they discuss Christianity a little bit during the Middle Ages, they are not ever going to have this basis for Judaism or Christianity later.”"
None of the encroachments of Islam in public schools should come as any real surprise.
"Multiculturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one’s own."
"The embarrassment, regret, and even self-hatred that has been inculcated in American public school students for decades now has created a vacuum, which Muslims have shown themselves to be all too eager to fill."
"Certainly, those who are furthering the Islamization of the schools would deny that they would like to see Islamic law implemented in the United States, and would indignantly reject the claim that their efforts were furthering that end in any way."
"They would say that they are doing it all for tolerance, pluralism, and multiculturalism."
"Unfortunately, in the end, it amounts to the same thing."

Not So Fast
Who can blame the North Koreans for blowing their tops?
"In case North Korea failed to get the message, the second exercise is code-named ‘Maximum Thunder.’"
Hardly an encouragement for North Korea.
North Korea was right on target when it accused arch-neocon John Bolton of trying to sabotage the peace deal.
"In 2005-2006, Bolton served as the Bush administration’s ambassador to the UN."
"He established a tradition for the post of being anti-Muslim, pro-Israel and anti-Russian, a policy continued to this day by the current US UN rep, loud-mouthed neocon Nikki Haley."
"In the 2005-2006 period, after years of negotiations, the US and North Korea were close to a nuclear/peace deal."
Enter John Bolton.
He succeeded in sabotaging the US-North Korea deal.
Why?
"As usual with the neocons, Israel’s interests came before those of the United States."
"Trump’s newly named Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, is also an ardent neocon."
"Last week, Bolton went onto US TV and actually suggested North Korea might follow the course set by Libya, of all places."
"Libya’s then ruler, Muammar Kadaffi, bought some nuclear equipment from Pakistan so he could hand it over to the US as a gesture of cooperation after the Bush administration invaded Iraq."
War at the Top of the ... Eric Margolis Best Price: $2.60 Buy New $24.57 (as of 09:00 EDT - Details)
The Northerners certainly seemed to think so.
Some wondered if Bolton and perhaps Pompeo were trying to sabotage the North Korea deal.
Hard to tell.
But he can’t be happy.
Or was the US military rattling its sabers and trying to protect its huge investments in North Asia?
The Pentagon takes a dim view of the proposed Korean nuclear accords.
"Veteran Korea observers, this writer included, find it hard to believe Kim Jong-un will give up his nuclear weapons, particularly after seeing Trump’s deceit in dealing with Iran and Kadaffi’s murder."
"Speaking of de-nuclearization, why does North Korea not demand that the US get rid of its nuclear weapons based in South Korea, Okinawa, Guam and with the 7th Fleet?"
Many are targeted on North Korea.
US nuclear weapons are based on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
Others are secretly based in Japan.
"Why not demand the US pull out all its 28,500 troops in South Korea and some 2,000 military technicians at air bases?"
Conclusively halt those spring and fall military maneuvers that raise the threat of war.
End the trade embargo of North Korea that amounts to high level economic warfare.
Establish normal diplomatic relations.
Pyongyang has not even begun to raise these issues.
Smiles and hugs are premature.

EXPERIMENTAL Ebola Vaccine Will Be Administered In Congo As Ebola Death Toll Climbs
The vaccination campaign will begin today.
"“The vaccination campaign begins tomorrow, Monday, in Mbandaka, capital of the province,” Minister of Health Oly Ilunga told The Associated Press as reported by 9 News Australia."
An experimental vaccine is one that has never been tried on humans before.
"Ebola hemorrhagic fever, seen mostly only in Africa, is one of the world’s most feared diseases."
"It begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by bloody diarrhea and vomiting."
"Days later, some victims begin bleeding through the nose, mouth, and eyes."
There is no cure for Ebola.
The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person.
"The death toll has reached 26 and the vaccine will be rolled out at Mbandaka, the north-western city of 1.2 million recently struck by the outbreak."
"Since the virus is spread through direct contact, an isn’t airborne, it isn’t nearly as deadly as it could be."
Read more here about Ebola and how it is transmitted:
"Initially, the campaign will target 600 people, mainly medical staff, contacts of suspected cases, and those who have been in contact with the contacts, Ilunga said."
"Officials are working urgently to prevent the disease from spreading beyond Mbandaka, which lies on the Congo River, a busy traffic corridor, and is an hour’s flight from the capital."
The fever can cause severe internal bleeding that is often fatal.
"Meaning, the virus itself doesn’t actually kill."
The immune system’s response to the virus is what’s deadly.
ZMapp is also an experimental drug that could aid in the recovery from the Ebola virus.
"But, like the vaccine being administered, it has not been tested for safety or efficacy yet."
It is not a vaccine – it is a therapeutic drug.
"Of the seven people given the drug so far, two have died."
"ZMapp show “promise,” although scientific results are not definitive."
"The WHO, however, stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global health emergency."
WHO said there should not be restrictions on international travel or trade.
"In the meantime, it’s important to prevent oneself from contracting the virus."
"Unfortunately, health care workers are at the greatest risk as they try to cull the suffering: which is why they will be the first to get the experimental vaccine."
People Call On White House To Pardon Oregon Ranchers Steve & Dwight Hammond
"A couple of years ago, I introduced you to the Hammon family, a rancher family out of Oregon that was targeted after the patriarch in the family and his son went to jail for doing what ranchers do, setting fires to protect property and livestock."
"Their story ultimately led to the Malheur Wildlife Refuge protest, which led to the murder of LaVoy Finicum."
"Now, many who have seen what took place both in the Oregon trials and the Bundy Ranch trials are calling on President Donald Trump to issue a pardon for Steve and Dwight Hammond."
According to the White House petition on behalf of Dwight and Steven Hammond by Protect The Harvest:

US staffer suffers brain injury after 'sound' incident in China | Bangkok Post: news
"An American flag is flown next to the Chinese national emblem during a welcome ceremony for visiting US President Donald Trump outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Nov 9, 2017."
(AP file photo)
"BEIJING: The US embassy in China issued a health alert Wednesday after a US government employee experienced an ""abnormal"" sound and suffered a mild brain injury -- in an incident reminiscent of a mysterious illness that hit diplomats in Cuba."
"US and Chinese authorities are investigating the matter after the employee, who was assigned to the southern city of Guangzhou, was diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), said embassy spokeswoman Jinnie Lee."
"In an alert emailed to US citizens in China, the embassy said it does not know what caused the symptoms or of any similar situations in the country."
"In Cuba last year, the US disclosed that 24 diplomats and their family members had fallen victim to an unsolved mysterious attack that left them with injuries resembling brain trauma."
Ten Canadian diplomats and their relatives also suffered a strange illness.
"""We cannot at this time connect it with what happened in Havana but we are investigating all possibilities,"" a US embassy official in Beijing told AFP on the condition of anonymity."
"The embassy's health alert says the government employee ""recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure""."
"""The US government is taking these reports seriously and has informed its official staff in China of this event,"" the message says."
"US and Chinese authorities are investigating the matter, an embassy spokeswoman said"
"""While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source."
"Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present,"" it says, urging people with medical problems to consult a doctor."
"Lee said the employee experienced ""a variety of physical symptoms"" between late 2017 through April 2018."
The person was sent to the United States and diagnosed with MTBI on May 18.
"""The (State) Department is taking this incident very seriously and is working to determine the cause and impact of the incident,"" Lee said."
"""The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures."""
The Chinese foreign ministry could not be immediately reached for comment.
- Cuban case -
"In Cuba, the American victims had associated the onset of their symptoms with ""unusual sounds or auditory sensations"", a State Department physician told the US Senate in January."
"Charles Rosenfarb, a doctor and director of the State Department bureau of medical services, said the symptoms were mixed but consistent with brain trauma."
"The victims suffered headaches, hearing loss, disorientation and some loss of cognitive ability."
(Video YouTube/TIME)
"Initially officials suspected the Americans had been targeted by some sort of acoustic weapon, although in public senior officials were more cautious, speaking of ""health attacks""."
Media reports have suggested that the FBI has not been able to verify any evidence to support the sonic weapon theory.
"The US government has held Cuba responsible, arguing that Raul Castro's authoritarian state must have either carried out the assaults or at least known who was behind them."
"The incident prompted the United States last year to withdraw more than half of its personnel at the embassy in Havana, which reopened in 2015 as the two nations re-established diplomatic relations that had ruptured in 1961."
Canada announced last month that it was bringing home the families of its diplomats in Cuba after a year-long investigation into the illness failed to reveal a cause.
"""The cause (of their symptoms) remains unknown but could be human-made,"" the Canadian government concluded."
"Canadian and US authorities had initially suspected a ""sonic attack"" or a ""mass psychosomatic incident"", but those are ""now considered unlikely"", a senior Canadian official said."
"The symptoms included dizziness, headaches and a lack of ability to concentrate."
"Unlike their American counterparts, however, no Canadian envoy reported hearing any suspicious sound prior to falling ill."
Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders
The Francis Vatican’s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis.
Contemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end.
It has no “use” in the sense that either the Bergoglians – in terms of their political machinations – or the world can understand.
There is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted.
One aspect of Pope Francis’ character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life – a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church’s undertakings.
The world does not understand it or want it.
"Therefore, it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side, and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it."
"So when, in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns, the faithful braced for impact ."
"Italian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly, “Rejoice and be glad… but not if you’re a cloistered contemplative.”"
"Unfortunately, it was about a subject that the world, and therefore the modern Church, cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed."
"Aimed specifically at female contemplative religious, the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations."
"The new document issued last week, “Cor orans,” is juridical, that is, it is not much more than a list of specific norms, or rules – 289 of them!"
– that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow.
One odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives:
"“A monastery of nuns, as every religious house, is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute.” (emphasis added)"
Wait… its “usefulness”?
"I think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be, “According to what specific criteria is a monastery’s ‘usefulness’ actually determined?”"
One can’t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe.
"A house that could prove to the secularists that it was “useful” – that it could care for the indigent elderly, teach children or nurse the sick – would be allowed to continue."
Those which were purely contemplative – a single-minded devotion to the adoration of God – were closed.
Rupture?
What rupture?
The first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post-Vatican II theology.
"In the Introduction, it seems anxious to establish a “hermeneutic of continuity” with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950."
"The authors insist there is no contradiction between the two – except, of course, where there are contradictions – and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the “aim of their specific vocation.” It describes Francis as promulgating this document “in the wake” of Pius XII[1]."
"In fact, Pope Francis, by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere, on June 29, 2016, to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation, invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular, but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points."
"As a consequence, the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision."
"But of course, the entire game is given away in the next paragraph:"
"Yes, that’s what it said."
How do you know?
Because we’re telling you it has.”
This is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document; “Nothing to see here.
"And if you say there is, you’re the problem.”"
"It’s your fault if you find contradictions, not theirs; they’ve said there are no contradictions, therefore there aren’t any."
"After all, this is the papacy where 2 + 2 = 5 if the pope says it does."
Why would the Vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since Vatican II has been hunky dory?
Let’s remember that this comes from the Congregation for Religious of Braz de’Aviz and Jose Rodriguez Carballo.
"This is the Cardinal Braz de’Aviz[2] who wasted no time in orienting himself in the New Paradigm when, close on the heels of the Conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor – and by extension Pope Benedict – to reign in the notorious Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the US."
Apparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following Vatican II[3] had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life – always claimed to be “mandated” by “the Council”.
Independence
But that word does not mean what they think it means.
"If the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery."
"When an autonomous monastery , it is the responsibility ofto the Holy See."
"As we will see, the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves Orwell in the dust:"
overcome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life.
"Federation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same Institute [4] , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, so that in sharing the same charism, the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life."
Note the change: “independent” is replaced with “isolated[5].” It reminds me of a conversation I had with a superior of a Benedictine house in the UK.
"She said she thought that the psychiatric testing, that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery’s federation, was excessive and not helpful."
"She didn’t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate’s suitability for religious life, so she didn’t require these tests of her monastery’s postulants."
"She also said that she was under constant pressure, both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation’s leadership."
Was that monastery “isolated”?
Or just exercising lawful self-governance?
"The word “fidelity” appears in the document four times, which may give an idea of how much interest the Vatican has in this issue."
"As we shall see, the document is what I’ve called above a “chopping block”."
"Vultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable, religious life worthy of life, so to speak, and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed."
Note the language used here:
"If the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery."
It jogged a memory for me.
“Incapacity”… Where had I heard that language used before?
Most pro-life observers in Britain will tell you that it was the “Mental Capacity Act” of 2005 that established in British law the concept that a person with permanently “reduced capacity” could be legally starved and/or dehydrated to death by doctors.
"This set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now, a “new paradigm” of ethics replacing traditional “Hippocratic” or “Natural Law” medical ethics."
"Under this system the onus, effectively, is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment – of continuing to live."
Health care systems like that of the UK have government regulatory boards giving out “guidelines” to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated.
These guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria.
"If the equation doesn’t come out in the patient’s favour, the “treatment” recommended for the patient’s “best interests” will include his demise, often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives."
"The NHS in the UK has actually gone to court, and won, declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the Bioethics test."
In one case a man with ALS took the NHS to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated.
"The system, in other words, is stacked against the patient, in favour of the government that holds all the cards."
Keep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document.
Federations as Vatican watchdogs
"Under this law, all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation."
"Previously only voluntary and consultative, federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates, nuns and of their formators, as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression."
The Federal Assembly:
"deals with issues of major importance; makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe, after the definitive approval of the Holy See;"
More than just federations; a multi-tier system of control
"In other words, Benedictine federations of a given area will form a “Conference” with Carmelite federations and Dominican federations and Poor Clare federations, etc."
"This will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially, since they tend to be generally more on the “conservative” end of things."
"Imagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings – and attempting to keep up their Office schedule – with the balloons-and-guitars, break dancing Franciscans…What fun!"
"And finally, just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock, there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas; there will be watchers watching the watchers:"
"Confederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries, erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism, to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations."
Broad powers
"Federations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and, crucially, over formation of nuns."
"It is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules, to report non-compliance to the Holy See, to make new foundations and, apparently, to “encourage” individual monasteries to “communicate” their goods."
"The legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire, possess, administer, and alienate temporal, movable and immovable goods, which are ecclesiastical assets, in accordance with the universal and proper law."
"To keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries, implementing one of the aims of the Federation, a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries, coordinated by the Federal President."
"The communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions, gifts, loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties, and for the common needs of the Federation."
The Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals.
Financial incentives
"Given that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like “vitality in living and transmitting the charism” and “dynamic fidelity” to the order’s charism, and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation, one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8]."
"Since the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery, this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind."
"Article 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek “legal recognition also in the civil sphere.” This, presumably, will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries."
"Article 73, on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct:"
"In the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery, when there are no surviving nuns, unless otherwise provided by the Holy See, the destination of the suppressed monastery's assets, in compliance with canon and civil law, go to the respective higher juridical person, that is, to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation."
"The economic fund [of the federation] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries, by the donations of benefactors, and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries, as established by the present Instruction."
Federations in charge of formation
"The Federation President, in particular, watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute, so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time."
"At the end of the visit, she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation."
"The formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation, therefore, the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation; if this does not happen, she will refer the matter to the Holy See."
"The President of the Federation, having heard the opinion of the Federal Council, chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators, as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority, establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community."
Who makes new foundations and why?
"Throughout the history of the Church, it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses."
"Now, with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right, according to this document, the federations themselves can make foundations."
"through the action of the Federation, as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns, keeping in mind what is established in no."
"39 of the present Instruction, can take place either by a single monastery or, as established by the Federal Assembly [9]"
"A single monastic community that decides to make a foundation, moreover, must be “helped” and guided by the federation:"
"In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery."
The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.
Article 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that “must be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective.”
"the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism,” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”."
"a) A community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with “” composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, “as long as most are not of advanced age”."
"b) Besides the number, special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume: as Superior, the service of authority; as formator, the initial formation of candidates; as financial administrator, the administration of the goods of the monastery."
"c) Rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community, to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their Institute."
d) Economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life.
One of these things is not like the others.
Did you notice?
"One criterion stands out as indeterminate, vague, compared with the other concrete and measurable standards."
One aspect of legislative analysis that I learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance.
If a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a “loophole”.
Or it could perhaps be described as a handle; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe.
"So, how, exactly, is it to be determined – and by whom – that a group of nuns possess “the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism”?"
"What, precisely, does the term “vitality” mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required?"
"Is this one of Pope Francis little personal, secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning?"
Like the secret to how nuns are to smile properly?
Does the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document?
Or is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates?
"The next article tells us, “It is the responsibility of the Holy See to evaluate the presence of these requisites.” Do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the Congregation for Religious that measures “charism vitality”?"
"It seems important to ask because article 70, on how to suppress a monastery, includes it:"
"Among the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery, after having examined all the circumstances, the following points should be considered as a whole: the number of nuns, the advanced age of the majority of the members, the real capacity for government and formation, lack of candidates for a number of years, lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity[10]."
You will be affiliated; resistance is futile…
Articles 54-64 offer an interim measure in the case of “incapacity” that is really just more of the second thing.
"54 Affiliation is a particular form of help that the Holy See establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy, but in reality, very precarious or, in fact, non-existent."
How does affiliation work?
"Well, the federation and the Holy See between them work it out:"
"In these cases, it is up to the Holy See to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the Ordinary, the Federation President, the Federal Assistant, and the Major Superior of the monastery"
It’s worth remembering what happened in the case of a German men’s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to pre-Vatican II practices.
"Mariawald Trappist monastery – 900 years old – was finally dissolved, affiliated to death."
"Mariawald was consequently affiliated, in the manner this document describes, with a liberal house in the Netherlands whose superior, unsurprisingly, discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved."
"60 The affiliated monastery can accept candidates, but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the Federation.”"
"Of course, this means it is the affiliating monastery’s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant, “neo-pelagian” postulants and novices."
~
This brings us to about article 155 of the document.
Part two to come.
_______________
"[1] It would seem, therefore, that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read Sponsa Christi Ecclesia as well as Francis’ Apostolic Constitution and make a careful comparison."
"I’m not going to do that here, but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point."
"[2] Worth remembering, however, is the fact that it was Benedict the “conservative,” not Francis, who appointed Braz de’ Aviz in the office to replace Cardinal Rode – presumably under that good old “conservative” rubric of the “big umbrella” – under whom these culpably belated attempts to save US religious life were started."
[3] Just considering the numbers of course.
Leaving alone the doctrinal issues.
"[4] “The same Institute” means the order in question, whether Benedictine, Dominican, Carmelite etc."
"[6] “justice and beneficence” are considered on behalf of the community, not the patient"
[7] Bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient “quality” it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy.
"[8] Readers may think I’m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries, but as we will see, the distinction between the federations and the Holy See is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the Congregation for Religious, Jose Rodrigues Carballo, was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of “tens of millions” of Euros from the coffers of the Franciscan Friars Minor, the original Franciscan order of which he had been the head."
"Shortly after Carballo’s appointment, it was revealed that the Swiss prosecutor’s office was investigating the money missing from the Friars Minor in connection with drugs, money laundering operations and gun running."
"Carballo was Francis’ very first appointment, April 6, 2013, three weeks after the Conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the FFIs, and a major part of that operation was to separate the FFIs from real assets valued at about 30 million Euros."
[9] So much for the principle of subsidiarity.
I can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in.
American in China injured in 'sonic attack' similar to Cuba
© Provided by Al Jazeera Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was moving medical teams to China over the 'sonic attack' [Leah Millis/ Reuters]
"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said a brain injury sustained by an American official in a ""sonic attack"" in China was similar to those that affected US and Canadian diplomats in Cuba."
"Pompeo's remarks on Wednesday came hours after the US embassy in China issued a health warning to Americans living there over an ""unusual"" auditory or sensory phenomena."
"The embassy said a US government employee in the southern city of Guangzhou reported experiencing a ""subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure"", which led to a mild brain injury."
"Pompeo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee the ""sonic attack"" in China was similar to the incidents in Cuba last year."
"""The medical indications are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba,"" he said."
"The US was moving medical teams to the area to work on the case, he said."
"""We are working to figure out what took place both in Havana and now in China as well,"" Pompeo said."
China's foreign ministry did not comment immediately.
"Heather Nauert, the state department spokeswoman, said the US embassy learned on Friday that the Guangzhou employee showed concussion symptoms after medical testing."
That is the same clinical finding doctors treating the Cuba patients at the University of Philadelphia found.
"The Guangzhou worker started experiencing ""a variety of symptoms"" starting in late 2017 that lasted through April this year, Nauert said."
"The worker was sent to the US for further evaluation, she added."
"In Cuba last year, 24 diplomats and their family members were left with mysterious injuries resembling brain trauma, which were suspected of being caused by a ""sonic attack""."
Ten Canadian diplomats and their relatives also suffered similar illnesses.
"The still-unexplained incidents sparked a rift in US-Cuban relations, while investigators have chased theories including a sonic attack, an electromagnetic weapon, or a flawed spying device."
"Symptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person, according to The Associated Press."
"Some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing."
Some struggle with concentration or common word recall.
An employee of the American embassy in Guangzhou was diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury
The US has warned its citizens in China to be vigilant for “abnormal sensations of sound and pressure” as it opened an investigation into whether officials were targeted with a sonic weapon that caused a brain injury.
"An American government employee stationed in the southern city of Guangzhou recently reported “subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure”, the embassy in China said yesterday."
The employee was diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury in an incident with echoes of suspected “sonic attacks” on American diplomats in Cuba last year.
"Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said that medical teams were travelling to Guangzhou to investigate."
"The government employee’s symptoms were “very similar and entirely consistent” with those suffered in Cuba, he…"
US embassy worker in China suffers 'brain injury' amid 'sonic attack' fears
"The state department has issued a health alert to its citizens in the country, adding that the unnamed staff member's symptoms indicate a ""mild traumatic brain injury""."
"The findings echo similar reports that caused the US to recall non-essential embassy staff from Cuba in 2017, after at least 24 US citizens suffered symptoms indicating they had been deliberately and covertly targeted."
"The unnamed government worker was based in the southeast port city of Guangzhou, where an American consulate is based."
"He has now been flown back to the US for assessment, according to reports."
"""Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present."""

"In an email to citizens in China, the state department said: ""A US government employee in China recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure."
"""The US government is taking these reports seriously and has informed its official staff in China of this event."""
They added that they are not sure what has caused the employee's symptoms.
"The US Secretary of Mike Pompeo has said he is concerned about the ""serious health incident"" that has affected an embassy worker in Guangzhou."
"China's foreign ministry and national health commission did not immediately respond to questions about the findings, the Associated Press reported."
"This can include a laser, microwaves, or particle beams."
Investigators also speculated that a flawed spy device could be behind the victims' ailments in Cuba.
Secretary of state Mike Pompeo met with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Washington on Wednesday.
"They were expected to discuss a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and the North Korea leader Kim Jong-Un, but concerns about the incident in Guangzhou are likely to have been raised."
"China and the US are considered strategic rivals for influence in Asia, but conduct hundreds of billions of dollars of annual trade with each other."

"Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan — along with Imran’s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend — worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for “numerous violations of House security policies.” Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported."
"In April 2016, the House’s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen’s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times."
"Though House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later."
"In the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared."
"Though Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing."
"In January 2017, in the days around his father’s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father’s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported."
"Abid’s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators."
"In one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI."
"BACON Q: [redacted] is your email address, isn’t it?"
"And you send emails from that address including two emails to the FBI, didn’t you?"
"GILANI A: Yes, a long time ago."
"Q: No, not a long time ago."
"March 5th, 2017."
"March 6th, 2017."
A: I forgot about that.
BACON: Ah.
Bacon did not respond to questions from the TheDCNF about how he knew Gilani had emailed the FBI on those dates….

U.S. warns of 'sonic attacks' in China
"BEIJING -- The U.S. State Department is warning U.S. citizens in China that a government employee reported unusual ""sensations of sound and pressure"" and was later diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury -- a case that recalls a wave of so-called sonic attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba."
"A health alert sent Wednesday said a U.S. government employee assigned to the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou reported ""subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure."""
The notification said the department was not aware of any other cases inside or outside the diplomatic community.
"But signaling the depth of their concern, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and all five U.S. consulates in the country held town hall meetings Wednesday so employees could ask questions and raise concerns."
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said the United States will send a medical team to Guangzhou next week to conduct baseline medical evaluations of all employees who desire one.
"""The department is taking this incident very seriously and is working to determine the cause and impact of the incident,"" Nauert said."
"Though the State Department has not linked this case to any other incident, news of unusual symptoms hitting U.S. government employees recalled a rash of incidents with U.S. and Canadian diplomats working in Cuba."
"The United States last year decided to withdraw a large number of embassy staff from Cuba after diplomats stationed there complained of symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, visual difficulties, headaches and fatigue."
"The American Foreign Service Association said then that government employees had been diagnosed with ""mild traumatic brain injury and permanent hearing loss, with such additional symptoms as loss of balance, severe headaches, cognitive disruption, and brain swelling."""
Details about the Guangzhou case are still emerging.
"Jinnie Lee, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said that from late 2017 to April 2018, a government employee assigned to Guangzhou reported a variety of physical symptoms."
The employee was sent to the United States for evaluation and treatment.
"On May 18, the embassy learned that the diagnosis was mild traumatic brain injury."
"""The medical indications are very similar, and entirely consistent with, the medical indications that were taking place to Americans working in Cuba,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday during testimony in Congress."
"""The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures,"" Lee said."
The health alert advised that U.S. citizens in China should consult a medical professional if they experience any symptoms.
"""While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source,"" the alert advised."
"""Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present."""

Islamizing the Schools: The Case of West Virginia
No non-Muslim student should be forced to write or say the shahada without the qualifier “Muslims believe that…” This is because it is a statement of faith.
"If the school exercise is requiring students to write it, it should be clear from the wording of the exercise that this is Islamic faith, not the student’s faith."
"That distinction has been glossed over in many, many school textbook presentations."
"This is in West Virginia, not Baghdad."

"Rich Penkoski, the father of a Mountain Ridge student, contacted me and explained the situation further."
He sent me the packets the school gave out for the Jewish and the Christian lessons and commented:
"Notice no bible verses, no reciting the 10 commandments or the Lord’s prayer."
No practicing writing in Hebrew (not even the 10 commandments) as compared to the Islamic packet.
"There are no statements of faith, nothing asking the students to write it or practice in any of the Jewish or Christian rituals."
Furthermore the principal of Mountain Ridge Middle School Dr.
Branch has used my words against me by saying the teacher did tell the students about the Lord’s prayer (my daughter as well as 1 other said this is false)[.]
He is using my arguments I made to him yesterday to protect the teacher.
The teacher today told the students the assignment was optional.
My daughter as well as other students were under the impression all the packet assignments were mandatory (the Jewish one and the Christian ones were mandatory).
I wrote to Dr.
Branch to share with him the resource that Miss Hinson used and point out that the material she gave the students did not include all the faith aspects for Christianity.
The students received 2 pages for Christianity from this resource while all the Islamic sections were left intact.
Here’s the link for you to review.
You will notice all the faith elements were left out for Judaism and Christianity while the Islamic section was left the way it’s presented.
https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/610/World%20Religions.pdf So she decided to use the extra resources for Islam and the school is saying that’s not indoctrination or proselytizing?
The faith aspects and the same considerations were not given to the others as they were for Islam.
This actually further proves my point that Islam was afforded special privilege over the others.
The school is backtracking and being deceptive to try and weasel out of this.
The teacher today clarified things for the students but that still does not excuse the fact that they are teaching the Islamic faith and asking the kids to participate in Sharia.
Look at the Islamic packet again.
They are asking the kids to write the beginning of Surahs.
The teacher still has not corrected the error that calligraphy was started by the arabs.
They are doubling down and only after being called on it are they trying to backtrack.
"In Volusia County, Florida, hundreds protested Islamic lessons in their “World History” text, a Common Core-approved high school history textbook."
And who is the biggest pusher of Common Core besides leftist progressives?
"The Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim Brotherhood front group, along with the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)."
"In Florida, CAIR is on the offensive (more here)."
History lessons in Islam are dawah – proselytizing for Islam.
Large public-school publishers have been bought by the Saudis.
"In West Virginia, it gets even worse."
What do they have to hide?
"Apparently, a great deal."
(And who is behind them?
Unidentified “adult friends.”)
He sent this message to me:
All this in school today because of the articles.
This is not a joke and needs to be investigated.
"I have contacted the school’s principal, Dr."
"Branch, and I trust that he will take this matter seriously and deal with it appropriately."

Another Sound Weapon Used To ATTACK US Diplomats: This Time In China
"A United States government employee assigned to the American consulate in Guangzhou, China suffered a mild traumatic brain injury similar to those reported by diplomats in Cuba."
"The unnamed worker reported, “subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.”"
"The government employee experienced the symptoms from late 2017 until April of 2018, according to the U.S. State Department."
“The employee was sent to the United States for further evaluation.
"On May 18, 2018, the Embassy learned that the clinical findings of this evaluation matched mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI),” Jinnie Lee, U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Beijing, told Gizmodo by email."
"“The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures,” Lee continued."
But this isn’t the first time a sound weapon has been used on American diplomats.
Cuba has been accused of using a similar device to cause brain trauma in Americans at the embassy in Havana.
It all started in the fall of 2016.
"Several of the affected diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of Barack Obama’s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba."
"The Daily Mail reported that one diplomat described being jolted awake in a Havana hotel room by a grinding, blaring cacophony."
"When he moved a few feet across the room, the noise stopped."
"Whether they heard anything or not, the consequences have been unmistakable — symptoms ranging from nosebleeds, nausea, dizziness and severe headaches to mild brain damage and permanent hearing or memory loss."
"Oddly, as soon as some of the victims left Cuba, they stopped hearing noises."
–SHTFPlan
The mysterious illnesses reported by U.S. government employees in Cuba are allegedly thought to be either a “sonic attack” or perhaps malfunctioning surveillance gear.
"It’s not known yet whether the injured government worker in China was targeted with any such device, despite reporting similar symptoms as the diplomats in Cuba."
"The U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou says that it hasn’t had any other reported cases of strange sounds being heard by American officials, but is taking the issue seriously."
"“If you have concerns about any symptoms or medical problems that developed during or after a stay in China, consult a medical professional,” the State Department said in a public release."
"“While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source."
"Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present,” the release said."
"The Cuban government continues to deny they attacked U.S. diplomats with a sonic weapon, and very little additional information is known about those who suffered through the strange ordeal."
"After months of investigations, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences."
"It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose."
Probe in consulate injury allegation finds no clues

China said on Thursday it has not found any trace regarding what the United States described as abnormal sound and pressure reported by a US government employee in China.
The employee was diagnosed with a brain injury.
"The US Mission in China issued an online health alert on Wednesday saying that the employee ""recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure""."
The mission said it does not know what caused the reported symptoms and is not aware of any similar situations in China.
"""China has conducted an earnest investigation and has given preliminary feedback to the US."
"So far we have not yet found causes or clues to the situation described by the US,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a daily news conference."
"China has always protected the safety of workers at foreign diplomatic missions in China according to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Lu said."
"The unnamed US citizen assigned to the consulate in Guangzhou had reported a variety of ""physical symptoms"" dating from late 2017 to April this year, the US embassy in Beijing said in an email."
The worker was sent to the US for further evaluation.
"""The clinical findings of this evaluation matched mild traumatic brain injury,"" the embassy said."
"The US State Department will send a medical team to Guangzhou early next week to conduct baseline medical evaluations of all consulate employees who request it, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said."
"In October, the US government expelled 15 Cuban diplomats for what it said was Cuba's failure to protect staff at the US embassy in Havana from mysterious health incidents at one point thought to possibly have been acoustic ""attacks""."
The cause of those incidents remains unresolved.

So which is it?
"During Ramadan, Muslims are exhorted to renew and deepen their devotion to Allah."
Hence it is a time when they’re supposed to grow more generous and kind toward their fellow Muslims.
"Ironically, even in doing this he is likely to fail to satisfy Muslims, or anyone."
"After all, after the Trump White House issued a similar statement last year, the Washington Post ran a lengthy piece in which several Muslims explained why the statement was unsatisfactory to them."
Why?
Because Trump had the temerity to mention jihad terrorism.
"Hamid continued: “We, as American Muslims, shouldn’t be defined solely in our relationship to bad things that we have nothing to do with."

"Under the first part of my ongoing analysis of “Cor orans,” a commenter wrote: “When the enemy wants to take a soul, he tries to make it give up prayer.”"
"“The Prologue [of the Rule of St. Benedict] set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.”"
"Dom Paul Delatte, OSB, Abbot of Solesmes"
Today I received an email from a monastery of cloistered Carmelite nuns about the new document from the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious.
"They’re helping me examine this document, having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants, to help me understand it from an inside position."
"These, I might add, are not what we would consider a “traditionalist” community."
They have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language.
"For obvious reasons I can’t identify them, even to say what country they are in."
It signals the end of the contemplative monastic life.
Especially for Carmel.”
"In fact, as the National Catholic Reporter piece said, the meeting itself was “unprecedented,” 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders."
This is the programme:
They will not have sense.
"We need to build, using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point.”"
"After breathing this threat, the cardinal continued, saying that because modern people’s “needs” are fundamentally different from what they were in the past, there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses – people like St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. John Cassian, St. Benedict, St. Bruno, St. Dominic, Sts."
"Francis and Clare, Sts."
Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted.
“These contexts have changed.
"And the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember, but also must be open to the culture of the present moment.”"
“We must not be closed to new things.
"God is not static,” the cardinal said."
"“God is always new movement – of light, of heat, of demonstration."
He speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time.”
"The congregation’s Secretary, Archbishop José Rodríguez Carballo, is reported as saying, “With this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council, we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference, non-negotiable, in the formation to the consecrated life.”"
"Not the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition, nor the Doctors, nor the mystics, nor any of the 2000-year-old tradition of religious life, from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period; just Vatican II."
"Carballo continues his remarks, giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered, contemplative religious life: “A consecrated life, a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family, in the church – inserted in the world."
"Not in conflict with the world, but inserted in continuity,” he said."
"It is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte, the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder, Dom Gueranger, who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict:"
"“After entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession, we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it."
There shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses: ‘The world is crucified to me and I to the world.’
"“Let us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences, to lessen the distance which separates us."
"The Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life: ‘No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.’ The world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it, and the words of the Imitation [of Christ] are always fulfilled: ‘Sometimes we think to please others by our company; whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us.’”"
How Cor orans will end St. Teresa of Avila’s reform of Carmel
"Sister T. continued, saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of St. Teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her Carmelite reform."
She acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations.
"These are already doing the Cor orans programme, having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices, “ongoing formation” courses for professed nuns, a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries."
Their funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches.
"In 2015, Carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the Father General Fr."
"Saverio Cannistra, a Mexican and devotee of Liberation Theology, to ask if they wanted an International Commission of Nuns to oversee the female houses place of the Carmelite Fathers."
"This suggestion was rejected, to the annoyance of Maccise."
"Maccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries, but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices."
"The push for these changes is still on, however, under the current General, an Italian, Saverio Cannistrà."
"Given the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by “ongoing formation” is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination, sprayed over with a micro-thin layer of pious language."
"But for Carmelite nuns, Sister said, these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of St. Teresa."
"Authentic autonomy, independence of formation and finances, “are essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism.”"
"“They go against our Constitutions, even though Cor Orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and Constitutions."
"Each Carmel has its own spirit, its own tempo, it’s own ‘feel.’ Each nun is called not just to the Order, but to a specific Carmel."
Formation in common is something we’ve been fighting against for years.”
St. Teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place.
And now it’s going to be done to us.”
“As though the Church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry.
"Our Constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed, but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering."
"It will also help the monastery become ‘less viable’ because by the time anyone younger is professed, the others will be dead.”"
"Another requirement will be for a “religious assistant,” a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain, to be assigned by the federation."
Sister writes that this was rejected “years ago” by Carmelite monasteries as undue interference.
"Article 23 states, for instance, “In discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery."
The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.”
"There are no options in this document, no choices, no recourse."
It’s all being done to us.
"In this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming, if not Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, then at least license and ‘choice’ for all, plus the ‘rights’ of women, here our rights are completely taken away.”"
Another nun has written saying that they cannot conceive of what these people mean by “ongoing formation”.
"Judging from other documents from already-federated Carmelites in Europe, it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take “courses” together with novices from other monasteries."
"The content of these course, of course, is to be formulated by teams of “experts” chosen by the Federation."
"Sister writes, “Cloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things."
Can they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of on-going formation.”
Apparently not.
"As I wrote in my first analysis piece, the document itself – that we must remember is a piece of legislation, a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do – starts by laying out its working premise:"
"Pope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions."
"Anyone who imagines that this document’s authors will allow leeway, that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or “conservative” communities from timid and cowed Vatican bodies like Ecclesia Dei, has failed to pay attention."
"They point to the Nashville Dominicans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Poor Clares of Alabama, where there are at least habits, (some) chant, common life and common apostolates."
"In the continuing analysis that will follow this article, we can see that the purpose of this document is to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anti-Catholic revolutionaries, now nearing the end of their lives 50 years after their initial near-triumph."
Its intention is mopping up; either to herd the remaining recalcitrants – those who have resisted even to the softened and conciliating degrees typical of “conservatives” – into the full post-conciliar “reform” instituted by the revolutionaries in the 1960s – or to close them.
"The thing is, the result will obviously be the same either way."
The whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the VaticanTwoist New Paradigm.
I have just received a document that was issued privately summarising the findings of a meeting of federated Discalced Carmelite nuns in Europe in 2009.
Federation: Belgium
number of convents: 11 Number of nuns: 120
solemnly professed: 119
in formation: 1 average age: 73
Federation: Belgium - Luxembourg.
number of convents: 11 number of nuns: 122
solemnly professed: 117
in formation: 5
average age: 75
Federation: Germany number of convents: 14 number of nuns: 178
solemnly professed: 170
in formation: 8
average age: 66
"The rest are similar, and I’ll be analysing this document in some detail in the next piece in this series, but the rest of the responses to the Father General’s questionnaire tell a similar story."
The German federation gave a summary of the efforts made to address these issues.
"“Path taken: For 15 years they have organized formation courses: on-going & initial formation, and for formators."
Meetings for prioresses.
Present Problems: Have got very old.
Some sisters are in care-homes run by Franciscans.
Possible Solutions: Two convents intend to amalgamate.”
A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?
"The meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian, Discalced, reform from Germany, five areas of Spain, three from France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia and the Holy Land [1] ."
"The reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place: federations with broad powers, including financial control and combined formation courses, “religious assistant” priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations."
"Today I’ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the “Federations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land” in Avila, February 2009."
Reconciled to managed extinction
"The report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, “infirmary Carmels,” nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation."
"Solutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by “religious psychologists,” ever more powers handed to federations."
This is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis’ New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism.
Very little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts.
"Indeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether."
The report from Great Britain notes: “18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years.
There have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process.
Two communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.”
"Only one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers."
"But in this situation, the “solution” undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for “a completely new structure,” whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books."
"The atmosphere is weirdly resigned – one federation report recommended simply “forgetting the numbers” – with many notes of mutual congratulation over “unity,” the creating of “links” and the “building of trust” and “dialogue” between communities."
"The report from Belgium – federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries – states tersely that their biggest problem is “ageing” but under “possible solutions” says only, “We want to continue along the path we have begun.”"
It is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2].
It is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention.
"Federation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation."
"This outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002."
"But the effects of the federating/formation courses are already being felt: “Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.”"
Path taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated.
"From the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation."
"Each year, we have one or two seminars, which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association."
The duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association.
"We invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses: sisters from Albania, Slovenia and Bulgaria."
"Present Problems: In general, in our Association the vocations continue growing, but there are differences between the monasteries."
"Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations."
"Possible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit."
These self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting.
"All speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses: shared “formation courses,” meetings of superiors, amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally “care homes” and houses given over entirely as infirmaries."

"They have established a formation-house for new vocations and held a month long intensive course according to the ratio, given by the same sisters of the federation."
In 2004 they established a Carmelite infirmary to help the communities.
"Courses have been organized to accompany the youngest sisters of the federation, given by a religious psychologist."
Present problems: ageing of the sisters and a lack of vocations; we have not arrived at any practical conclusion in the way of amalgamations-restructuring though attempts have been made.
The incorporation of sisters from other countries without due discernment in some cases.
Possible solutions: we are making enquiries.

What has been done: there has been one suppression and two convents have amalgamated
Present problems: ageing of the sisters and a lack of vocations.
We need outside help.

Number of convents:16
Number of nuns: 229
Solemnly professed:
In formation: 10
Average age: 69
"What has been done: there has been work on formation: each year, a course on on-going formation and one for those recently professed."
There have been 3 suppressions and 3 amalgamations.
"Work will continue in this area, in order to keep a balance within the communities, based on the present communities and the new vocations."
"Present Problems: Ageing of the communities, resulting in weakening of life in all its facets."
It is not easy to express the reality.
A lack of vocations is with us as a reality in everyday life.
"Moreover, the high number of Carmels makes difficult to maintain all presences."
"Possible Solutions: It is completely necessary to assume the way of the restructurings, in order to live what is essential, forgetting the numbers."
"The challenge to grow in confidence and communion should lead us to downgrade the famous and untouchable autonomy because, to a daughter of Saint Teresa, the really important thing is to look for HIM and to live in obedience."
Another of our challenges is caring [for] the ecclesial presences.
We think this is the way will lead us to recreate from the interior the Charism of the Mother Teresa.

The federal priority is the formation.
"There has been a lot of work in formation: for prioresses, formators & initial."

Number of nuns: 220
Solemnly professed: 209

Average age: 65
Present problems: there are big differences between the various convents.
The number of vocations has diminished quickly and the numbers increased of those who have left during formation and during the first years of solemn profession.
Nonetheless there have not been amalgamations or suppressions.
In some convents old age is a real concern.
Possible Solutions: They are working on formation through courses.
Also on communion between the communities.
There are meetings of the Council with the communities.
We are ready to accept sisters who cannot be cared for in their own communities.
"However, this has not been accepted because they do not want to be separated."
"The strangest report came from the Netherlands where, for a single surviving autonomous monastery and an average age of 81, resources were mobilised to create “a completely new structure,” complete with approval from the Congregation for Religious:"
Federation: Netherlands
Date when erected: 1971
Number of convents: 6
Number of nuns: 73
Solemnly professed: 73
In formation: ....
"Average age: 81 [NB, the bold was in the original.]"
What has been done: 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation.
This has created a close communion from the beginning.
Everyone has collaborated in the process of amalgamations and suppressions.
Present Problems: Only one Carmel functions fully autonomously in the Netherlands.
4 communities are in a care-home run by the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception.
Another Carmel was renewed in 1990.
At the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing; it is run by Franciscan sisters.
"With the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation, according to the faculties described in the statutes, in particular regarding our mutual solidarity."
"Also, with the passing of the years, the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation."
"Finally, the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests."
Due to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible.
We are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters.
The structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.
"Possible solutions: The Federation Council, the Religious Assistant, together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious, have worked hard on a completely new structure, in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind."
We began from three points:
"1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist, but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation."
"2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation, preferably appointed by the Superior General."
"The team will consist of a president and vice-president who are members of one of the convents, appointed to functions, and of three people who are members, or not, of one of the convents."
"3)A Supervisory council, also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General, which will be made up of three members, whose president will be, preferably, a member of a religious institute, preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions."
This council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation.
"In October 2008, the President, the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals."
They had meetings with Fr.
General and with the Congregation for Religious.
These were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters.
An important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council.
"We were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter, but we think that, in view of our present situation today, we do not have much choice."
"It is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel."
Definitive permission came at the 25th of February.

"Sr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious told them that the “two great challenges to our contemplative life” are “the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.” She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation."
Cor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:
The nuns were exhorted to “stay awake to welcome the dawn” of a bright new future:
"“These are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.” “Our aim must be to be open to the future."
We should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps.
It is a wide road that opens up before us.
We must be women of hope and faith.
We must always believe that God is the one who directs history.
"From this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).” [emphasis in the original.]"
"Instead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the “problems and difficulties that we can encounter” in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including “consumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.”"
"Given that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis/Kasper, one wonders what this “new dawn” was actually about."
Was Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?
It is certainly clear from Francis’ first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities.
"His first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation’s Secretary and – given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them – the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor."
Certainly this record of the European Carmelites’ meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way.
"On the final day of the meeting, the “theme for the day” was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: “Government: the need for change."
Autonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr.
General; other solutions to government.”
"The devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone’s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: “Essential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,” the Father General warned."
And there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works.
"A common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to “ask questions” rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:"
“Who discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people?
“Are there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations?
“At the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced.
"Stability is one reason [for autonomy], but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church?"
"“The valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life, though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy."
Can such essential autonomy continue as it is?
“50 years ago there was stability.
How do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation-Association and between autonomy and Fr.
General?
“Could there be other forms of government?”
"Following the Father General’s address are notes from the language groups, including the following:"
"“While some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched, and have certain fears of ‘external’ interference, others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that, without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form, where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain, our hands tied."
"Though we want these legal channels to be established, it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are, in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same.” “...The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when… the same person remains prioress for years.” “...We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy."
We perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures.
"We do not want new figures but rather those that already exist (Associations, [federation] Presidents, Provincials...) be empowered in a legal way (canonically) to help communities in difficulty, for the mission to discern, to counsel, to accompany.” “...We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations, we see that we should be close to them.”"
"Maybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018, now that the “progressivist” faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction."
"What comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican’s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic, heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it."
And with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads.
But this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion.
_____________________
[1] An aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist readers is the little comment in the report on the difficulty of having a liturgical observance between all the disparate nations represented at the meeting.
“Eucharist and Lauds in Spanish.
Fr.
Isidore D’Silva had prepared a booklet with the liturgy for each day.
"Each psalm was in a different language, and was prepared by the corresponding liturgical group."
"However, having the text in front of us made it easier to follow the recitation in other languages."
The end result was that we could all join in the liturgy.
We were all united in the praise of the Spirit who had brought us there together from different languages and nations.”
"[2] Solution: new foundations, the spreading of the Carmelite charism into new territories."
"[3] This includes all sisters up to final profession, not just postulants and novices."
Removing one’s children from government schools seems a rational response to school shootings.

Ex-Navy sailor pardoned by Trump says he's suing Comey and Obama
"A former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials, alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law."
"Specifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information."
"His lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others."
"“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton."
Hillary is still walking free.
Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.
We want them to correct the wrong.”
Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.
There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.
"“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said."
“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”
"While campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned."
Trump often compared the Obama administration’s handling of Saucier’s case with that of Clinton.
"Saucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009."
"He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine's propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera."
"Saucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked."
"But he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton's emails."
"“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” he said."
"Saucier, 31, said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter."
A felony conviction left him scrambling to find work; he finally landed a job collecting garbage.
"Now, he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company."
"“Things are starting to go in the right direction,” Saucier said."
"“I work with a group of really great people, I get to use my skills set.”"
"Because of the loss of income during his imprisonment, as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage, he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure."
Debt collectors called and his cars were repossessed.
"“With a pardon there’s no magic wand that that gets waved and makes everything right,” he said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.”"
"He praises the pardons that Trump has granted, and takes exception at the criticism."
"“The Obama administration singled out Dinesh for things most people don’t even get charged for,” Saucier said."
“President Trump noticed that my career was exemplary and that I didn’t deserve what happened to me.
"Conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who was pardoned by Trump last week, had pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud."
"Trump tweeted Thursday: ""Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today."
D'Souza was sentenced in 2014 to five years of probation after he pleaded guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a U.S. Senate campaign in the names of others.

Patrick J. Buchanan: Boehner's Right—It's Trump's Party Now | Articles
"See, earlier Trump Victorious As GOP Transformed Into A National Conservative Party by James Kirkpatrick, May 3, 2016"
"""The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere."""
"Ex-Speaker Boehner should probably re-check the old party's pulse, for the Bush-Boehner GOP may not just be napping."
Consider.
"That GOP set out to create a new world order where dictatorships were threatened with ""regime change,"" and democratic capitalism was the new order of the ages."
"Yet, Donald Trump captured the Republican nomination and won the presidency—by saying goodbye to all that."
"How probable is it that a future GOP presidential candidate will revive the Bush-Boehner agenda the party rejected in 2016, run on it, win, and impose it on the party and nation?"
"A brief history: In seven elections starting in 1992, Republicans won the presidency three times, but the popular vote only once, in 2004, when George W. was still basking in his ""Mission Accomplished"" in Iraq."
What fractured and overwhelmed the Bush-Boehner Republican Party?
"First, demography."
"The mass immigration of Third World peoples that began with the 1965 immigration act, and the decline in the birth rate of native-born Americans, began to swamp the Nixon-Reagan New Majority."
"Between 1997 and 2017, the EU ran up, at America's expense, trade surpluses in goods in excess of $2 trillion, while we also picked up the bill for Europe's defense."
"In Trump's first year, China's trade surplus with the United States hit $375 billion."
"From January to March of this year, our trade deficit with China was running at close to the same astronomical rate."
"""Trade deficits do not matter,"" we hear from the economists."
"They might explain that to Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania."
"And perhaps someone can explain the wisdom of handing 4 percent of our GDP each year to an adversary nation, as U.S. admirals talk tough about confronting that adversary nation over islets and reefs in the South China Sea."
Why are we enriching and empowering so exorbitantly those whom we are told we may have to fight?
"Fourth, under Bush II and Obama, the U.S. intervened massively in the Near and Middle East—in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen."
"They may get this war, too."
"Yet, given the anti-interventionist and anti-war stance of Trump's winning campaign, and of the Bernie Sanders campaign, U.S. involvement in Middle East wars seems less America's future than it does her past."
The world is changing.
NATO and the EU are showing their age.
"Nationalism, populism and tribalism are pervasive on the Old Continent."
"And America's willingness to bear the burden of Europe's defense, as they ride virtually free, is visibly waning."
It is hard to see why or how Republicans are ever again going to be the Bush-Boehner party that preceded the rise of Trump.
"Trump not only defeated 16 Bush Republicans, he presented an agenda on immigration, border security, amnesty, intervention abroad, the Middle East, NAFTA, free trade, Putin and Russia that was a rejection of what the Bush-Boehner Party had stood for and what its presidential candidates in 2008 and 2012, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had run on."
We are in a new world now.

"Though he had lifted the title of his August anti-Trump polemic, ""Conscience of a Conservative,"" from Barry Goldwater, Jeff Flake is no Barry Goldwater."
"Flake, with only 18 percent approval in Arizona, decided to pack it in rather than get waxed in his own primary."
But the real threat Trump represents is to the GOP establishment's control of the party's agenda and the party's destiny.
"U.S. politics have indeed been coarsened, with Trump playing a lead role."
"About $12 trillion in trade deficits, $4 trillion with China alone, a loss of 55,000 plants and 6 million manufacturing jobs."
"U.S. elites made China great again, to where Beijing is now challenging our strategic position and presence in Asia."
"Yet, still, the GOP establishment has not repudiated the mindset that produced this."
Consider.
"What was the GOP establishment's reply to the opposition to amnesty for illegals and calls for a moratorium on legal immigration, to assimilate the tens of millions already here?"
"Moreover, a new question arises:"
"For though unpleasant, it is not unfair to say that if there was one desire common to Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump voters, it was be rid of the regime resting on top of all of us."
Traditionalists have been told that for years.
Now it's the turn of the GOP establishment to learn the truth as well.
"Goldwater lost badly, but the establishment that abandoned him never had its patrimony restored."

Trump suggests he would have picked another AG who could have blocked Russia probe
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would have picked another attorney general if it would have stopped an investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 election.
"In his latest public slam at Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- who, citing his involvement with the Trump campaign, recused himself from the investigation last year, paving the way for the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller -- Trump said he would have ""quickly picked someone else"" had he known about the recusal."
"""The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday."
"""I would have quickly picked someone else."

"His lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others."
"“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton."
Hillary is still walking free.
Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.
We want them to correct the wrong.” Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.
There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.
"“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said."
“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”
Saucier's attorneys attempted to use the Hillary Clinton defense to get him out of hot water for taking pictures of classified systems aboard the USS Alexandria in 2009.
"Prosecutors sloughed off the defense, saying it was essentially “grasping at highly imaginative and speculative straws in trying to further draw a comparison to the matter of Secretary Hillary Clinton based upon virtually no understanding and knowledge of the facts involved, the information at issue, not to mention any issues if intent and knowledge.”"
"Saucier confessed to taking photos of the submarine back in 2009 when he served as a 22-year-old machinist mate, saying he wanted to show the pictures to his family and future children."
"Following an interview with the FBI in 2012, he destroyed all evidence of the pictures, meaning the Naval Criminal Investigative Service could not confirm his claims that he did not share the photos with unauthorized people."
We don’t believe this was really his true character.”
"“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” Saucier said."
President Trump had spoken of his support of Saucier on the campaign trail and blasted the Obama administration's handling of his case.
"“With a pardon, there’s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,” Saucier said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.”"
That's a good attitude considering he has had his cars repossessed and is in a tremendous amount of debt due to his incarceration and now having a felony on his record.
"But hey, Hillary is free, right?"

National Data | December Jobs—TRUMP EFFECT!
"American Worker Displacement, Immigrant Population, Black Unemployment ALL DECLINE!"
| Articles
)
December marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year.
"Simultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September."
"And, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low."
"According to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016—a decline of 0.18%."
"This follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November."
"Not since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months—but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding."
Note that this is a net figure.
The year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in.
"About 300,000 immigrants die annually, and an equal number leave (voluntarily or otherwise), according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies."
[U.S.
"Immigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period—the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants."
This helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).
"The additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers’ immigrant status (but not their legal status)."
"The Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month—well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey."
In December 2017:
"Immigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93%"
"Native-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 – up 0.27%"
"The immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to 120.9."
The native-born American employment index rose from 105.8 to 106.0..
"The New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell fromto(100X (120.9/106.0))"
Trump may not have delivered (yet) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs so many of his supporters lost during the Obama years.
"But by shrinking the pool of immigrants willing to do that work, he has put more money in pockets of his voters."
While overall wage growth remains modest – 2.5% per annum in December – Blue collar workers have beat this by a wide margin:
"…In the year [2017] to the third quarter, wage and salary growth for the likes of factory workers, builders and drivers easily outstripped that for professionals and managers."
"In some cases, blue-collar pay growth now exceeds 4%…” Blue-collar wages are surging."
"Can it last?, The Economist, Magazine, November 14th 2017"
Eleven months of Trump has not come close to undoing the damage done by eight years of Obama.
Native-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years and this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election:
"Can't render, error"
"Native-born American employment growth is represented by the black line, immigrant employment growth is in pink, and NVAWDI—the ratio of immigrant to native-born American job growth—is in blue."
"Another way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment rose steadily, albeit erratically, throughout the Obama years."
"Immigrants held 16.99% of total jobs in December, a significant drop from November’s 17.16% share."
"Can't render, error"
A detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.
Over the last 12 months (December 2016 to December 2017):
The native-born American labor force (employed plus looking for work) grew twice as fast as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.
as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.
American employment grew 57% faster than immigrant employment: 1.27% versus 0.81%.
"The labor-force participation rate (LPR), a sign of worker confidence and mobility, rose by 0.6 points for immigrants and was unchanged for native-born Americans."
"At 65.3%, the immigrant LPR this December was considerably above the native-born American rate (61.9%.)"
"The number of unemployed Americans fell by 763,000—down 12.7%, while the number of unemployed immigrants fell 129,000—down by 11%."
"Another piece of good news, quite possibly connected to the shrinking of the immigrant working age population, caught our eye: The unemployment rate for black Americans fell to 6.8% in December , the lowest level since the Labor Department began tracking the figure in 1972."
"[ U.S. economy added 2 million jobs in 2017 , by Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney, January 5, 2018]"
"By removing foreign competitors, Trump may have done more for blacks in 11 months than Obama did in eight years."
"Of course, this could be affected by statistical noise—and it could be undone by e.g."
a DACA capitulation.
But right now it increasingly appears the Trump Effect is real—and achieved entirely through enhanced enforcement.

National Data | May Jobs: We Unveil The New VDAWDI | Articles
A rough patch—or a double-dip recession?
And Wall Street is plainly beginning to panic.
Unemployment is a case in point.
But unemployment is befuddling anyway.
"Just a few weeks ago professional prognosticators were expecting job growth of 175,000 in May."
"However, nonfarm payroll growth came in at 54,000 in May, the smallest gain since September, and a fraction of the just lowered consensus forecast (125,000 jobs.)"
"The ""other"" employment survey, of households rather than businesses, also broadcast mixed signals—at least so far as the prospects for native-born workers are concerned."
"VDARE.com has long argued that the household survey captures the employment of illegal aliens; additionally, it actually mentions ethnicity."
"In May, according to the Household Survey, total employment rose by 105,000."
Non-Hispanics actually gained ground:
"Total employment: up 105,000 (+0.08 percent)"
"Non-Hispanic employment: up 190,000 (+0.16 percent)"
"Hispanic employment: down 85,000 (-0.42 percent)"
"Thus VDAWDI—VDARE.com's American Worker Displacement Index, unveiled in 2004 and still unique—fell to 126.2 in May from April's 127.0 level."
"This, of course, is atypical statistical noise."
Non-Hispanics have lost jobs at twice the rate of Hispanics since the recession hit in December 2007.
"And since the official start of the ""recovery"" in June 2009, Hispanics have gained 416,000 jobs while non-Hispanics have lost 675,000 positions."
"Since January 2001 the number of non-Hispanics holding jobs has declined by 1.9 million, or by -1.6%."
"Over that same period Hispanic employment rose by 3.9 million, up a whopping 24.2%."
"This Hispanic/non-Hispanic divide was, of course, a convenient proxy for VDARE.com's primary interest: foreign-born workers and their role in displacing their native-born counterparts."
We tracked this by looking at Hispanics because such a high proportion of them are foreign-born—and because the federal government declined to provide data on immigrant vs. non-immigrant unemployment.
"However, since January 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] has begun to publish figures for foreign-born and native-born employment."
"These data are not seasonally adjusted, making month to month trends difficult to interpret."
BLS resolves the dilemma by comparing the current month with the same month of the prior year:
"By this measure also, May 2011 is notable for some catching up on the part of native-born workers—at least when compared to the same month of 2010:"
"Employment Status by Nativity, May 2010-May 2011 (numbers in 1000s; not seasonally adjusted) May-10 May-11 Change % Change Foreign born, 16 years and older Civilian population 35,647 36,348 701 2.0% Civilian labor force 24,210 24,253 43 0.2% Participation rate (%) 67.9% 66.7% -1.2%pt."

Thus over the past 12 months:
"Immigrants and native-born Americans both experienced the same 0.4% job growth, with 440,000 more natives and 91,000 more immigrants at work."
The immigrant unemployment rate fell by 0.2 points; the native-born rate fell by 0.7 points.
The share of immigrants holding jobs fell by 1.6%; the share of natives holding jobs fell by 0.2%.
Labor force participation rates fell by 1.2% points for immigrants and 0.8% points for natives.
The immigrant population of working age increased by 2.0%; the comparable native population grew by 0.6%.
"By an amazing coincidence, January 2009—the month President Obama took office—is also the earliest month of data published in BLS's new foreign and native-born employment table."
"Coincidence or not, this means we can piece together the monthly points to see the President's priorities, or at least his practical effect."
"Setting the job count at 100.0 for both native-born and immigrants in January 2009, immigrant employment ticked up to 102.9 in May—am increase of 2.9%."
Native employment ticked down to 97.5—a 2.5% decline.
"We label this ""The New VDAWDI""."
"From January 2009 through May 2011 the New VDAWDI, calculated using foreign-born and native-born employment figures, grew by 5.5%."
"By comparison VDAWDI, calculated using Hispanic and non-Hispanic employment figures, rose by 3.3% over the same period."
"As we've found before, our older measure of American Worker Displacement understated the problem."
"In all but a few months of the Obama Administration, native-born workers have lost ground to immigrants"
Americans.
"National Data | May Jobs: Displacement Stalls, Americans Take All New Jobs—But For How Long?"
| Articles
"Finally, the shocking surge in immigrant displacement of American workers and in the immigrant workforce, which began in January and completely undid the improvement we had begun hopefully to call the “Trump Effect” has stalled."
But displacement and immigrant workforce growth are still high in absolute terms and could resume anytime.
In May:
"Immigrant employment fell by 1.068 million, down by 3.81%."
Native-born American employment rose by 1.361 million—up 1.1%
"The immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell to 124.7 from 129.6 in April."
The native-born American employment index rose to 106.6 from 105.4 in April.
"The New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell to 117.0 from the all-time high,123.0, recorded in April."
"Can't render, error"
"In other words, Trump has not even begun to repair the damage done by eight years of Obama."
Native-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years.
"And, shown above, this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election."
"In normal times, this might be a big story."
"Nd anyway, they almost never report the immigration dimension."
May 2018 was the fifth consecutive month in which the foreign-born working age population (including illegals) grew by more than 1 million from the same month the prior year.
"But May’s growth was less than that in April and March, possibly an emerging trend."
"Can't render, error"
In May 2018 there were 1.342 million more working-age immigrants than in May 2017.
"year-over-year, in March and April, respectively."
"The last five months of 2017 saw the foreign-born population fall by an average 100,000 from the same month of the prior year (shown in red on our chart)."
These are net figures.
"Over a 12-month period an average of perhaps 300,000 immigrants die and an equal number leave the U.S. voluntarily."
"So the 1.342 million net rise in foreign-born population, May 2017 to May 2018, implies that nearly 2 million foreign-born individuals may have actually settled in the country over those 12 months."
(This excludes tourists and other short-term entrants.)
"In percentage terms, the immigrant working-age population grew 3.24% over the 12 months."
"If this growth rate persists, it portends a doubling in 22 years."
"By contrast, the native-born American population rose 0.63% over this period —a rate that will require 114 years for a doubling."
Another way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment:
"Can't render, error"
Immigrants accounted for 17.36% of total employment in May.
"Note that, while significantly below the all-time high of 18.1% recorded in April, the May figure is third highest among the 113 months for which we have data."
A detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.
"Employment Status by Nativity, May 2017- May 2018 (numbers in 1000s; not seasonally adjusted) May-17 May-18 Change % Change Foreign born, 16 years and older Civilian population 41,390 42,732 1,342 3.24% Civilian labor force 27,315 27,923 608 2.23% Participation rate (%) 66.0 65.3 -0.7 pts."

Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall
A new Senate report reveals that Barack Obama secretly paved the way for Iran to tap into U.S. banks to convert cash it received from sanctions’ relief to dollars — despite the face the White House assured lawmakers it would do no such thing.
The report shows how State Department and Treasury Deparment officials during the Obama era quietly gave a special license for a major Omani bank to do business with two U.S. banks.

Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?
The U.S. banks were pressured into complying with the deal.
The Washington Times has more:
"A copy of the report, obtained by The Washington Times, outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction, all while misleading lawmakers about the activities."
She also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against “deceptive” Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists.
"The Iranian government “uses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks” as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran’s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, Ms. Mandelker said."
"Iranian officials said the increase, while provocative, does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord."
"He made the comment a day after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord."
The Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama’s team was willing to go to ensure the deal’s success as it was still being negotiated.
"The Senate Homeland Security Committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks, facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars."
"“Senior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,” according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times."
"“Despite these claims, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the U.S. State Department, granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system."
"“Even after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system,” the report said."
Sen.
"Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel’s findings Wednesday."
"Under terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained “illegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.”"
The ban included any “intermediary” transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran — a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system.
"On the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015, Tehran had some $5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to Senate investigators, who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar."
"On Tehran’s request, Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department’s office of foreign assets control."
According to the Senate report: “Muscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros.
"[But] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars.”"
"Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would “continue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market” under the proposed accord, but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran."
"“On February 24, 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system,” according to the Senate report, which claims the move was made “even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.”"
"Even as office of foreign assets control officials directly “encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds,” the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction, said the report, which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, that contended the Obama “administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system.”"
"The catch, according to Senate investigators, was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange — in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic."
"Despite the Obama administration’s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system, the Senate investigators said."
"“Despite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits, the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system,” Mr. Portman said."
"“The only reason this transaction wasn’t executed was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the administration asked them to help convert the money.”"
"Such sanctions, he added, “are a vital foreign policy tool, and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness.”"
Spygate Coverup?
https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/spygate-coverup/
Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) accuses the Republican House leadership of dragging their heels in the Spygate investigation.
"This has been evident for months now, as there are many connections and obvious questions that haven’t been investigated."
The FBI files contain memos that need to be scoured too.
"The House leaders are Paul Ryan (Speaker of the House), Kevin McCarthy (Majority Leader), Steve Scalise (Majority Whip) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (House Republican Conference Chair)."
There is a decided lack of aggressiveness of this investigation.
"If Ryan is correct, an investigation will show it; but the current evidence suggests he is wrong."
"There is a kind of coverup at work here in which important Republicans do not want to bolster Trump by adding substance to Spygate, and they do not want to clean up the FBI by aggressively investigating Spygate further."

"Obama Secretly Tried to Get Banks to Aid Iran, Banks Refused"
International financial institutions get a lot of heat for terror state ties.
But this is a case where Obama Inc. tried to get them to do the wrong thing.
While they did the right thing.
"The Obama administration secretly sought to give Iran access — albeit briefly — to the U.S. financial system by sidestepping sanctions kept in place after the 2015 nuclear deal, despite repeatedly telling Congress and the public it had no plans to do so."
And that's part of why Spygate is happening.
The assault is also a cover-up.
"The report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016, never previously disclosed, that would have allowed Iran to convert $5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman from Omani rials into euros by exchanging them first into U.S. dollars."
"If the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license, it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system."
The effort was unsuccessful because American banks — themselves afraid of running afoul of U.S. sanctions — declined to participate.
"The Obama administration approached two U.S. banks to facilitate the conversion, the report said, but both refused, citing the reputational risk of doing business with or for Iran."
The banking system was more reluctant to help Iran launder money than he was.
Nor was Obama worried about the reputational risk of loading foreign currency on unmarked cargo planes and flying it to Iran.
Issuing the license was not illegal.
"Still, it went above and beyond what the Obama administration was required to do under the terms of the nuclear agreement."
Except Obama Inc. weren't trying to drive a hard bargain.
So they didn't stick to it.
They were trying to aid Iran.
Obama administration officials at the time assured concerned lawmakers that a general license wouldn’t be coming.
"But the report from the Republican members of the Senate panel showed that a draft of the license was indeed prepared, though it was never published."
"And when questioned by lawmakers about the possibility of granting Iran any kind of access to the U.S. financial system, Obama-era officials never volunteered that the specific license for Bank Muscat in Oman had been issued two months earlier."
GOP report: Obama admin worked to allow Iran to exchange billions to bypass sanctions
Washington (CNN) Senate Republicans on Wednesday accused the Obama Administration of secretly trying to give Tehran access to the US financial system to convert billions of dollars in assets into Euros as part of the Iran nuclear deal.
"A report released by Republican senators on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation said the Obama administration didn't tell Congress that it sought access for Iran and, in its eagerness to clinch the nuclear deal, was trying to dodge sanctions that remained in place following the 2016 agreement."
"Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee and opposed the Iran deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action."
The accusations were rejected by Obama administration officials who said Republicans are trying to make a one-time effort to meet obligations under the nuclear deal sound like an attempt to give Iran broad access to the US financial system.
"They said the Republican senators never interviewed former Obama administration officials involved, and noted that no Democrats were involved."
Iran deal reverberations
"The report and the former officials' response highlight how controversial the Iran deal continues to be, even after President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to leave the international pact."
That move continues to roil relations with European allies who are sticking with the Iran deal.
They appealed to the US on Wednesday to exempt them from sanctions as they continue to do business with Tehran.
"But one goal behind report's release, according to an official familiar with its contents, is to make clear that the US is not likely to be open to exemptions of any kind."
"""As the United States begins to re-impose sanctions on Iran and Iranian entities, our European allies must understand and appreciate that doing business with Iran is no longer permissible,"" the source said."
"The report focuses on $5.7 billion from Iranian oil sales that were frozen in Oman's Bank Muscat in that country's currency, the rial."
Rials are pegged to the US dollar and are difficult to convert.
"But as part of the nuclear deal, Iran was promised access to overseas reserves of its own funds that had been frozen by sanctions."
"To access the rials, Iran wanted to convert them briefly into dollars and then Euros."

"The majority report by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation says that the US Treasury, at the instruction of the US State Department, granted a license to convert the $5.7 billion briefly into American dollars so it could be converted into euros."
"The exchange was legal, the report notes."
"Officials at Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control asked two US banks to work as intermediaries and execute the transaction, but they declined, citing concern over potential regulatory backlash and a ding to their reputations."
Emails reviewed in the investigation show that OFAC officials worked to encourage banks to take part in the deal by proposing to bring in senior officials.
"""I agree it would be a good idea to have (Treasury Secretary Jack) Lew engage (the US bank)."
"If they refuse we can suggest (Secretary of State John) Kerry will call, which will drive them nuts,"" an email from a US government official said."
"It looks like we committed to a whole lot beyond just allowing the immobilized funds to settle out."""
A legal transaction
"But in the end, Treasury officials concluded that the transaction was legal."
"The report said they decided that the terms of the JCPOA were ""consistent with Iran's position, allowing the Government of Iran to engage in 'transfers,' 'foreign exchange (including Rial related transactions),' and the 'purchase or acquisition by the Government of Iran of US bank notes.'"""
"The source familiar with the report said that Congress asked the Obama administration directly about such a license, but that the administration was under no legal obligation to provide the licenses to Congress."
"The Republican report argues that in pushing for the license to go forward, Obama officials were violating financial and oil-related sanctions imposed on Iran stemming from the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and trying to give Iran access to the US financial system."
"They pointed to a number of Obama officials, including Lew, who said in congressional testimony that Iran was not granted access to the US financial system."
"Lew said in 2015 that Iran ""will continue to be denied access to the [US's] financial and commercial market."""
"Treasury's acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence during the Obama administration, Adam Szubin, claimed that ""Iranian banks will not be able to clear US dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with US financial institutions, or enter into financing arrangements with US banks."""

"Blanc argued that the administration was transparent with Congress, referencing Lew's own testimony."
"""As Secretary Lew said in the testimony quoted in the report: 'Part of the agreement was to give Iran access to money that it has a right to."
We will work on making that happen.'
"There were regular staff level briefings in much more detail,"" Blanc said."
"That source pointed out that the license ""did not authorize Iran to conduct commercial transactions denominated in US dollars."
The GOP report offers recommendations on how best to proceed with its relationship with Iran.
"Recommendations include further informing Congress about future negotiations with Iran, requiring the Treasury Department to give notice of specific licenses, reviewing all Iran deal-related licenses, and increasing policing of US sanctions policies."
"Former head of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is on the front line of aiding and abetting Awan and his associates as has been revealed by Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller."

"Ex-Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she intervened in a Pakistani land deal involving her then–IT aide Imran Awan, according to two House employees."
"The dispute came after Awan’s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report."
"The congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan’s whole family to her daughter’s bat mitzvah and said she had “helped him with a land deal,” the sources said."
A spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story.
"Awan’s father purchased “huge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,” but all the checks bounced, the report said."
"“About a dozen farmers of Chak 7-JB, Panjor, including five siblings — all aged between 57 and 70 — have given up hope of justice after they sold their agricultural lands to Ashraf Awan of Bole De Jhugi, who is father of White House employee Shahid Imran,” Dawn reported."
"Imran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show."
"The police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with “frivolous” cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said."
"A third source, who’s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened."
A fourth source — a fellow House IT aide — previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved.
"Dr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that “Imran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.”"
"On July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family."
"Awan, his wife, two brothers, his brother’s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz’s Florida."
"The finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking."
"In February 2017, Kiko and the House’s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network."
The letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence.
"But Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on “websites” and “printers,” which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access."
"The congresswoman also added Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network."
"Wasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 — 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase."
The story also said Wasserman Schultz had a “friendly personal relationship” with Awan and Alvi.
Fleet did not respond to a request for comment.
"“Termination, now it’s the member’s responsibility … We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,” he said."
"Wasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said."
"House investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence."
"Yet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, “my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.”"
"Despite Wasserman Schultz’s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 — two months after he was banned from the computer network — the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk."
"Capitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan’s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said “attorney client privilege,” according to a police report."
"Awan’s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it."
"That led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with “consequences” for not returning the laptop."
"When he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police’s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it."
"Wasserman Schultz hired the House’s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard — who had recently quit the House — to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported.Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami — one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton."
Wasserman Schultz’ district includes much of Miami.
"One of Awan’s lawyers told a judge he felt “very strongly” that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument."
Prosecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge.
"In August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January."
"Prosecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret."
"Capitol Police “requested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn’t want to tip off the employees,” she said."
Wasserman Schultz’s brother is a prosecutor in the same office handling the case and has tweeted about it.
Wasserman Schultz did not respond to a request for comment.
"The Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday that “the Obama administration skirted key U.S. sanctions to grant Iran access to billions in hard currency despite public assurances the administration was engaged in no such action, according to a new congressional investigation.”"
"This revelation comes after the news that came to light in February, that, according to Bill Gertz in the Washington Times, “the U.S. government has traced some of the $1.7 billion released to Iran by the Obama administration to Iranian-backed terrorists in the two years since the cash was transferred.”"
There is a law that applies to this situation.
"Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan?"
"Yes, the doughface Presidents made the Civil War inevitable, but worse came later."
Grant?
Wilson?
Harding?
"Nah: his tax cuts and return to “normalcy” got the American economy, and the Twenties, roaring."
FDR and LBJ gave us the modern welfare state and dependent classes automatically voting Democrat; the full bill on the damage they did hasn’t yet been presented.
Nixon?
Carter?
He showered hundreds of billions of dollars on the Islamic Republic of Iran.
"There are those who say, “It was their money."
"It belonged to the Iranian government but was frozen and not paid since 1979.” Indeed, and there was a reason for that: not even Jimmy Carter, who made the Islamic Republic of Iran possible, thought that money, which had been paid by the Shah’s government in a canceled arms deal, belonged to the mullahs who overthrew the Shah."
"Likewise Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush all thought that the Islamic Republic was not due money that was owed to the Shah."
Only Barack Obama did.
There is no telling when the worst consequences of Obama’s aid and comfort to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be felt.
But they likely will be felt in one way or another.
"Even as President Trump moves swiftly to restore sanctions and put Iran on notice that its nuclear activity and global adventurism will not be tolerated, those billions cannot be recovered, and the Iranians have already spent a great deal for their jihad cause."
That’s Leftist Privilege.
It’s good to be a powerful Leftist in Washington nowadays.
Laws?
Pah!
Laws are for conservatives.
"According to The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Florida, was the last straw for scores of parents."
"The paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”"
"“In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled."
That’s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg.
The left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools.
"Ray said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment."
"“Most parents homeschool for more than one reason,” Ray told the paper."
It includes all of that.”
People cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong – even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it.

It isn’t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves.
Homeschooling Expands As Parents Seethe Over Liberal Social Engineering And Violence
"The paper noted that “the phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven’t stopped yet.”"
"“In the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled."
That’s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg.
The left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools.
"Brian D. Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who’s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents."
"Ray said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment."
"“Most parents homeschool for more than one reason,” Ray told the paper."
"“But when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity."
But humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries.

It isn’t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves.
Iran Admits To Aiding Al-Qaeda and Facilitating 9/11 Jihad Terror Attacks
"This has long been known, although the mainstream media dismissed it as a conspiracy theory."
But now we have definitive confirmation.
"It was Iran Bush should have invaded after 9/11 , not Iraq."
"Now consider this: even though, as President of the United States, Barack Obama had access to information that the general public does not have, and certainly knew of Iran’s involvement in the 9/11 attacks, Obama still pursued the Iran nuclear deal and gave billions to the Islamic Republic."
"“Iran Admits To Facilitating 9/11 Terror Attacks,” by Adam Kredo, Washington Free Beacon, June 8, 2018:"
"Iranian officials, in a first, have admitted to facilitating the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. by secretly aiding the free travel of al Qaeda operatives who eventually went on to fly commercial airliners into the Twin Towers in New York City, according to new remarks from a senior Iranian official."
"Mohammad-Javad Larijani, an international affairs assistant in the Iran’s judiciary, disclosed in Farsi-language remarks broadcast on Iran’s state-controlled television that Iranian intelligence officials secretly helped provide the al Qaeda attackers with passage and gave them refuge in the Islamic Republic, according to an English translation published by Al Arabiya."
"“Our government agreed not to stamp the passports of some of them because they were on transit flights for two hours, and they were resuming their flights without having their passports stamped."
"However their movements were under the complete supervision of the Iranian intelligence,” Larijani was quoted as saying."
The remarks represent the first time senior Iranian officials have publicly admitted to aiding al Qaeda and playing a direct role in facilitating the 9/11 attacks.
The U.S. government has long accused Iran of playing a role in the attacks and even fined the Islamic Republic billions as a result.
The U.S. 9/11 Commission assembled to investigate the attacks concluded that Iran played a role in facilitating the al Qaeda terrorists.
Larijani admitted that Iranian officials did not stamp the passports of the al Qaeda militants in order to obfuscate their movements and prevent detection by foreign governments.
Al Qaeda operative also were given safe refuge in Iran….

"Dennis Bernstein: We continue our discussion of the case of Julian Assange, now in the Ecuadorian embassy in Great Britain."
"John Pilger, it is great to talk to you again."
John Pilger: I have never known anything like it.
Julian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days.
"He is cut off from the very tools of his trade, visitors aren’t allowed."
"I was in London recently and I couldn’t see him, although I spoke to people who had seen him."
But really it comes down to the British government.
"Although he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has Ecuadorian nationality, his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the British government."
The United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear.
"It is very good that you are doing this, Dennis, because even in the media outside the mainstream, there is this silence about Julian."
Number one is justice.
"Instead, I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage!"
It is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly.
"How do you respond to journalists acting like prosecutors, some of whom used his material to do stories?"
This is a terrible time for journalism.
JP: You are absolutely right: It is a terrible time for journalism.
"That said, it is not new."
There has always been a so-called mainstream which really comes down to great power in media.
"It has always existed, particularly in the United States."
Like Webb
The Julian Assange case reminds me of the Gary Webb case.
Bob Parry was one of Gary Webb’s few supporters in the media.
Webb’s “Dark Alliance” series contained evidence that cocaine trafficking was going on with the connivance of the CIA.
The CIA Inspector General subsequently vindicated him.
"Now, Julian Assange is a long way from taking his own life."
His resilience is remarkable.
The Guardian a few years ago got a Pulitzer Prize writing about Snowden.
But their coverage of Snowden left him in Hong Kong.
It was WikiLeaks that got Snowden out of Hong Kong and to safety.
The persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from WikiLeaks.
I suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this.
My understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed.
"They realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago, and that is to tell us how governments lie."
Any serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated.
Eight Hundred Thousand Disclosures on Russia
And now we have the DNC suing WikiLeaks!
"I mean, none of this came from the Russians."
"If you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and WikiLeaks gets the documents to show it, they will publish no matter who you are, be they the United States or Russia."
"DB: Randy Credico, because of his work and his decision to devote a very high-profile series to the persecution of Julian Assange, recently found himself under attack."
JP: Randy shouted some truth.
It is very similar to what happened to Ray McGovern.
Ray is a former member of the CIA but extremely principled.
There was something highly emblematic about that for me.
He stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture.
DB: There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel.
Then the word “collusion” is quite appropriate.
JP:That’s the ultimate collusion.
In the media these were described as “clashes.” Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people.
"A rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted."
Where does he come into the picture?
JP:I think it comes down to information.
"If you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret."
The right to know what governments are doing in our name—on our behalf or to our detriment—is our moral right.
Julian feels very passionately about this.
There were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation.
I was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region.
This was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup.
It detailed how subversion should work.
I was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela.
It also reminds us that so-called “meddling” by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense.
The word “meddling” doesn’t apply to the kind of action implied in this document.
It is intervention in another country’s affairs.
WikiLeaks has done that all over the world.
It has given people the information they have a right to have.
They had a right to find out from the so-called “War Logs” the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"That’s when, on Clinton’s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers."
You can see why Julian made enemies.
But he should also have made a huge number of friends.
This is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise.
DB: And who can forget the release of the “collateral murder” footage by Chelsea Manning?
JP: That kind of thing is not uncommon.
Vietnam was meant to be the open war but really it wasn’t.
There weren’t the cameras around.
"DB: Yes, and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement."

The bipartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors passed a series of resolutions calling for more gun control measures during the group's annual meeting in Boston this week.
"The conference is advocating measures to strengthen the regulation of gun sales and dealers, as well as ban assault weapons and large-capacity magazines."

"“The U.S. Conference has a 50-year history of formally adopting and aggressively promoting strong policies to reduce gun violence, all consistent with its support for the Second Amendment to the Constitution,” the group said."
"Additionally, the group called for steps it said would protect young people — like opposing letting teachers and other non-law enforcement personnel be armed in K-12 schools — and cited incidents like February’s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, as impetus for its push."

Gun control advocates including the group Everytown for Gun Safety lauded the move.
"“Mayors are on the frontlines of America’s gun violence crisis, so it’s no surprise they’re also leading the charge to pass common-sense, life-saving laws,” Everytown President John Fienblatt said in a statement."
FBI IG Report: A Slap On The Wrist
"Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz has released his 500 plus-page report, which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State under former President Obama."
Such mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols.
"The report from the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey, together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe, including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe."
Mr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts.
Mr. Horowitz’s report focused on process and procedures.
"The inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in January 2017 that “his review will not substitute the OIG's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions."""
"To be sure, the report faulted Comey for deviating from FBI and Justice Department procedures in handling the probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State, thereby negatively impacting “the perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice.” Comey, according to the OIG report, “engaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice.”"
"He “upset the well-established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions,” the report said."
"Comey’s follow-up letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6, 2016 were similarly criticized."
"The first letter informed Congress that agents were reopening their probe into Clinton’s handling of classified material after discovering her e-mails on the laptop of Andrew Weiner, the husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin."
"This letter was followed on November 6, 2016 by Comey’s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the FBI remained convinced that charges were not appropriate."
Comey acted against the advice of senior Justice Department officials in making these disclosures the way he did.
"The OIG report was highly critical of the FBI’s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late September 2016, rather than waiting another month so close to the election."
"The criticisms of Comey's undisciplined behavior was all well and good, but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation."
"Hillary Clinton’s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general’s criticisms of Comey’s handling of the July 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in President Trump’s favor, even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons."
"The fix was in as early as May 2016, well before the FBI interviews of Hillary Clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses, when Comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo."
"Indeed, Comey admitted in his book that “we started the Clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the Department of Justice would prosecute.”"
"Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the edits."
"Mr. Horowitz’s report thus concluded, “We did not identify evidence of bias or improper considerations.” This conclusion defies common sense."
"Clinton was fully aware of what she was doing when she set up the private server arrangement in the first place and knowingly used it to send and receive e-mails involving official government business, which by their very nature would be expected to include classified information."
It turns out that some of the e-mails were accessed by foreign parties.
Hillary lied repeatedly when she first denied there were any classified e-mails on her system and then described some of the e-mails involved in the investigation as having been classified after the fact.
"As Comey has admitted, several e-mail chains concerned matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received by Clinton."
Yet Mr. Horowitz saw no reason to doubt the sincerity of Comey's explanations for giving Hillary a free pass.
"Incredibly, however, Mr. Horowitz’s report “found no persuasive evidence… that the outcome of the investigation would have been different had Clinton been subpoenaed before the grand jury.”"
Mr. Horowitz also did not deem Comey’s possible perjury in his testimony before Congress to be an appropriate subject for criminal referral.
"Comey testified that his decision to exonerate Hillary was not made before her interview took place, when for all intents and purposes it was."
Mr. Horowitz simply took Comey’s word for what he had meant.
"Inspector General Horowitz again emphasized form and process over substance in finding a “troubling lack of any direct, substantive communication” between Comey and Attorney General Lynch ahead of Comey’s July 5 press conference on Clinton and his October 28 letter to Congress."
"As to the substance of Ms. Lynch’s decision to meet with Bill Clinton at all before his wife’s FBI interview, all Mr. Horowitz’s report had to say was that it was “an error in judgment.”"
"Trump is “not ever going to become president, right?"
Right?
!” Page texted Strzok.
“No.
No he’s not.
"We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded."
"Mr. Horowitz wrote that this exchange was “not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.” The inspector general questioned whether Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia collusion investigation over following up on the Clinton e-mail-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias."
Strzok should have been subject to a criminal referral for arguably violating 18 U.S.C.
"§ 595, enacted as part of the original 1939 Hatch Act, prohibiting any public officer or employee, in connection with an activity financed wholly or in part by the United States, from using his or her official authority to interfere with or affect the nomination or election of a candidate for federal office including the president of the United States."
"The punishment for violation is a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year or both."
"Instead, Strzok's punishment will most likely be limited to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal."

"At the end of the day, Horowitz was unable to find solid proof that the agency acted in a politically partisan and biased manner in the Clinton email case."
"While the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI’s handling of the Clinton probe, it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI’s political leanings in his Russia report."
The Washington Post explains:
"“[Trump’s] not ever going to become president, right?"
Right?
"!” the lawyer, Lisa Page, wrote to Strzok."
“No.
No he won’t.
"We’ll stop it,” Strzok responded…"
"The messages “potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,” the inspector general wrote…"
"Strzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump couldn’t win, and that he wasn’t implying that they would take action to stop his election."
Page and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton.
"The report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views, faulting them for having brought “discredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI’s handling of the midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.” The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe."
"“The messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,” Horowitz alleged."
"“Ultimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and, indeed, the entire FBI.”"
"By no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned “virtually every fact” it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner’s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin."
"The report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead."
Did you get that?
"IG Horowitz can’t prove it, but he’s not sure that Strzok wasn’t acting in a politically biased manner when he slow-played the Clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the Russia investigation."
"We see this kind of corruption all over the world, why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases?"
"There were 7 of them on the case, and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases!"
"Not only that, the team that handled Clinton’s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the Russia investigation!"
"Meaning, the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported, was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to Russian corruption."
"Not only was he slow-playing the Clinton investigation, he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime."
"In a newly released FBI email, we learned that “foreign actors” gained at least some access to Hillary Clinton’s unsecure email system."
"Fox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week’s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz."
"The IG, separately, is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday."
"The House committees, which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017, addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton’s email security."
"“Documents provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton’s emails — including at least one email classified ‘Secret,'” the memo says, adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers."
Here’s the email in question:
Peter Strzok email about Clinton emails by Fox News on Scribd
At HotAir.com John Sexton explains the importance of this discovery:
"In the FBI memo, you can already see the genesis of the distinction the FBI would rely on to clear Clinton."
Strzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why Hillary seems to be getting a pass when “Petraeus/Berger/Libby” did not.
"He writes, “We draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party, i.e."
"notwithstanding the server setup, we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media, an agent of a foreign power, a lover, etc.” In other words, Hillary may have been hacked but she didn’t intentionally give anything away."
"Of course, the statute itself didn’t make intent a prerequisite."
"Herridge reports that the House committee memo once again raises this same issue: “Officials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the Espionage Act by stating Secretary Clinton lacked the requisite ‘intent’ for charges to be filed,” the memo says, before pointing to statements by Comey that indicated a belief that intent was required — which the memo says ignored “meaningful aspects” of the law."
"It really does seem that Strzok, an agent who had a personal pro-Hillary bias, was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place."
"However, I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he’s concluded his Russia investigation."
"In fact, there are already signs of him doing that in this report."
"Much of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok’s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case, would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess."
We’ll see.

"With What the Qur’an Meant: And Why It Matters, religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us:"
"Some people are sure it is there, though it isn’t."
Then what does it say about Shari’ah law?
Not a thing (p. 7).
"That would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness."
"Unfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite: Wills laments “Robert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur’an” (p. 58)."
"I have never called for such a ban, and oppose in principle the banning of any book."
"Wills, not surprisingly, does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim."
His manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur’an.
Wills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur’an.
"He renders one key passage in this way: “Fight then until there is no more persecution, and worship [at the shrine] is devoted to God” (2:193; p. 133)."
Whence the bracketed interpolation “at the shrine”?
Wills doesn’t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself.
"By adding “at the shrine” to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca."
He ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims.
"Wills doesn’t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them."
"Likewise, when he claims that the Qur’an has “not a thing” to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur’an is one of the sources of Sharia."
"The Qur’an’s declarations that a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who “wage war against Allah and his messenger” are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions."
"Because these stipulations are found in the Qur’an, they cannot be questioned or set aside."
He asks why the Qur’an is “so ferocious to ‘hypocrites’ and apostates” (p. 124).
"Wills concludes: “The Qur’an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God’s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness” (p. 126)."
"That sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur’an is more merciful than the New Testament."
"Until one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur’an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur’anic passage on this topic:"

"Wills’ peaceful fantasy Qur’an raises one massive question that the author does not and cannot answer: if the Islamic holy book is really as peaceful and benign as Garry Wills makes it out to be, why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?"
"The Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur’an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book’s core tenets."
"ISIS quoted the Qur’an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain; in explaining its priorities in the nations it is targeting in jihad; in preaching to Christians after collecting the jizya (a Qur’an-based tax, cf."
"ISIS also awarded $10,000 prizes and sex slaves in Qur’an memorization contests."
One of its underground lairs was found littered with weapons and copies of the Qur’an.
Children in the Islamic State study the Qur’an and get weapons training.
One Malaysian Muslim said that the Qur’an led him to join the Islamic State.
A Muslima in the U.S. promoted the Islamic State by quoting the Qur’an.
An Islamic State propagandist’s parents said of him: “Our son is a devout Muslim.
How would Garry Wills explain all that?
Francis has proclaimedpreposterously that “authentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.” Wills’ book accords well with the present-day Catholic Church’s head-in-the-sand posture toward Qur’an-based Islamic jihad violence and the Muslim persecution of the ancient Christian communities of the Middle East.
"It isn’t remotely accurate, but it feels good, and for the Catholic and Leftist establishment today, that seems to be all that matters."

"Sara Berg, a senior writer at AMA, was the author of the lengthy post which calls for all sorts of government overreach and unconstitutional legislation."
"And though she has a huge laundry list of things the AMA supports, she fails, like every other Socialist and Communist, to tell us exactly how these measures keep people safe and weapons out of the hands of criminals."
Berg and the AMA want to pull a Dick's Sporting Goods and demand that people be 21 before they can purchase a firearm.
"Do they not know that 18-year-olds carry firearms, both handguns and rifles?"
"I ask, as I do with the issue concerning alcohol, what is magic about the age of 21?"
"I ask, where does government get to determine who gets to do whatever at whatever age based on an ambiguous age number?"
Wrong.
"Yeah, that's gonna keep people safe."
It's going to infringe on the rights of those who don't commit crimes and need a gun to protect themselves or be part of the constitutional militia.
"The AMA also wants to bypass the Fifth Amendment protections concerning someone actually being indicted and found guilty of a crime being deprived of their liberty and property as they promote a new legal procedure by which “family members, intimate partners, household members and law enforcement personnel” can petition courts to confiscate firearms from people “when there is a high or imminent risk for violence.”"
"They want to do what President Donald Trump suggested and ""take the guns first"" and forget due process."
See?
Who knows exactly what they mean by high-capacity magazines.
"I mean, for the most part, you can obtain 20 or 30 round magazines for both handguns and rifles."
"In some cases, you can purchase drums which hold 50-100 rounds, but if you are in New York, the NY SAFE Act defines your high capacity magazine to hold anything more than 7 rounds."
"At the 2018 AMA Annual Meeting, delegates adopted policy for the AMA to support: Establishing laws allowing family members, intimate partners, household members and law enforcement personnel to petition a court for the removal of a firearm when there is a high or imminent risk for violence."
"Prohibiting persons who are under domestic violence restraining orders, convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes or stalking from possessing or purchasing firearms."
Expanding domestic violence restraining orders to include dating partners.
Requiring states to have protocols or processes in place for requiring the removal of firearms by prohibited persons.
Requiring domestic violence restraining orders and gun violence restraining orders to be entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
Efforts to ensure the public is aware of the existence of laws that allow for the removal of firearms from high-risk individuals.
The delegates also modified existing policy to: Recognize the role of firearms in suicides.
Encourage the development of curricula and training for physicians with a focus on suicide risk assessment and prevention as well as lethal means safety counseling.
Newly adopted policy also means the AMA will:
Advocate for schools to remain gun-free zones except for school-sanctioned activities and professional law enforcement officials.
Oppose requirements or incentives of teachers to carry weapons.
"I also oppose it because it's just another step for the federal government to say they need a database so states can check, thus identifying gun owners and possibly their weapons."
"“Every day,” Dr. Barbe added, “physicians are treating suicide victims, victims of domestic partner violence, and men and women simply in the wrong place at the wrong time."
"It doesn’t have to be this way, and we urge lawmakers to act.”"
Stop Comparing Immigration Enforcement to the Holocaust
The media has 2 very simple rules for Holocaust analogies.
1.
"The Muslim Brotherhood's leaders praising Hitler, calling for another Holocaust and killing Jews is nothing like the Holocaust."
Then Hayden doubled down on that analogy.
Repeatedly.
But instead it seems to have whetted his appetite for making them.
Every country arrests people.
Just about every country splits up families when they arrest the parents.
That's not unique.
Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam
"British politician Nigel Farage once helped convince Britons to vote for Brexit and separate from the European Union, but British establishment politicians have done everything they could to sabotage that vote since then."
"Now Farage has apparently decided that if he can’t beat them, he’ll join them — if not on Brexit, then in their stance of denial and appeasement regarding the global jihad threat.’"
Sure.
Now how does Farage propose to do that?
No sane person is saying that the West should go to war with the entire Islamic world.
"The likeliest interpretation of his statement is that he is saying that we must not speak about how jihadis find justification for their actions in the Qur’an and Sunnah, as that will alienate the “moderates.”"

Julian Assange
The Australian government and prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have an historic opportunity to decide which it will be.
Assange does not ask for special treatment.
We know from the Chelsea Manning case what he can expect if a U.S. extradition warrant is successful — a United Nations Special Rapporteur called it torture.
"In 2008, a plan to destroy both WikiLeaks and Assange was laid out in a top secret document dated 8 March, 2008."
The authors were the Cyber Counter-intelligence Assessments Branch of the U.S. Defence Department.
They described in detail how important it was to destroy the “feeling of trust” that is WikiLeaks’ “centre of gravity”.
Against the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $9.95 Buy New $9.95 (as of 06:00 EDT - Details)
The aim was to silence and criminalise WikiLeaks and its editor and publisher.
Vichy Media
The irony is that no one told these journalists what to do.
WikiLeaks Exposed Clinton
"Leaked emails published by WikiLeaks revealed that Hillary Clinton’s foundation – which she shares with her husband – received millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the main backers of ISIS and terrorism across the Middle East."
"Instead, she invited Clinton to describe the “damage” Julian Assange did “personally to you”."
The WikiLeaks Files: T... WikiLeaks Best Price: $2.50 Buy New $7.00 (as of 05:50 EDT - Details)
Awards were lavished and celebrated as if Julian Assange did not exist.
Maligning and Profiting off Assange
WikiLeaks’ revelations became part of the Guardian’s marketing plan to raise the paper’s cover price.
They also revealed the secret password Julian had given the Guardian in confidence and which was designed to protect a digital file containing the U.S. embassy cables.
The question is why.
Julian Assange has committed no crime.
He has never been charged with a crime.
"This is not easy; the U.S. Constitution protects publishers, journalists and whistleblowers."
Assange’s crime is to have broken a silence.
They Never Happened
"Seven years ago, in Sydney, I arranged to meet a prominent Liberal Member of the Federal Parliament, Malcolm Turnbull."
"I wanted to ask him to deliver a letter from Gareth Peirce, Assange’s lawyer, to the government."
"We talked about his famous victory — in the 1980s when, as a young barrister, he had fought the British Government’s attempts to suppress free speech and prevent the publication of the book Spycatcher — in its way, a WikiLeaks of the time, for it revealed the crimes of state power."
Ecuador invoked the 1951 Convention and granted Assange refuge in its embassy in London.
Malcolm Turnbull is now the Prime Minister of Australia.
Julian Assange’s father has written to Turnbull.
"It is a moving letter, in which he has appealed to the prime minister to bring his son home."
He refers to the real possibility of a tragedy.
I have watched Assange’s health deteriorate in his years of confinement without sunlight.
"He has had a relentless cough, but is not even allowed safe passage to and from a hospital for an X-ray."
He can bring Julian Assange home.

According to the mayors:
"Strengthening the Regulation of Gun Sales and Dealers, including: Limiting the number of guns a person may purchase in a single transaction or in a month or other specified period of time;"
Banning replica handguns;
Increasing inspections of licensed gun dealers; and
"Targeting and holding responsible gun dealers who break the law by knowingly selling guns to straw purchasers; Banning Assault Weapons and Large-Capacity Magazines, including: Reinstating a strengthened, effective ban on military-style assault weapons, such as AK-47s, and their component parts; and"
Banning large capacity ammunition feeding devices and the importation of all large capacity ammunition clips.
"Supporting Local Efforts to Reduce and Combat Gun Crimes, including: Opposing concealed carry reciprocity policies and legislation that would circumvent city policies established to protect residents;"
Providing local governments and law enforcement officials access to ATF gun trace data;
"Opposing ""Stand Your Ground"" or ""Shoot First"" laws and urging state legislatures that have adopted such laws to repeal them; and"
"Encouraging mayors to take executive actions to combat gun violence and illegal use and trafficking of guns; Protecting Young People, including: Opposing proposals to allow teachers and other non-law enforcement, non-security personnel to carry firearms in K-12 schools;"
Raising the youth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of age;
Banning juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles; and Holding gun owners criminally liable when children gain access to improperly stored guns.
"Protecting Domestic Violence Victims, including:"
Prohibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes or subject to final domestic violence restraining orders from acquiring or possessing firearms; and
Requiring prohibited domestic abusers to turn in firearms they already own;
How does any of this stop gun violence?
It doesn't.
"Banning semi-automatic weapons doesn't stop crime either, as we've pointed out before, and the statistics are available for anyone to see that gun violence didn't go down one bit during the decade of the Clinton/Feinstein assault weapons ban."
"Again, this will do nothing to stop criminals with guns."
Why?
"On top of that, the criminal mayors want to institute red flag laws."
"""The U.S. Conference of Mayors registers its strong support for extreme risk protection order laws and urges both states and the federal government to enact such laws,"" the group wrote."
Guns.com reported on some of the statements made by some of these mayors.
"Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana and chairwoman of the conference’s criminal and social justice committee, said gun-related tragedies “rips families and communities apart.” “Policies like background checks on all gun sales and Red Flag Laws save lives."
"It’s as simple as that,” Freeman-Wilson said."
“Our bipartisan network of mayors knows how to work together and compromise on policies that save lives.
"If only our partners in Congress did the same.” Gun control groups, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, praised the conference for reaffirming its support for stricter regulations."
None of these statements can be backed up by facts.
"If you buy into this, you probably think places like Chicago, Illinois are among the safest places to live in the US when the opposite is true."

'Textbook Definition of Bias'
"On Monday, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified with FBI boss Christopher Wray before the Senate Judiciary Committee."
"In a predictable performance, the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti-Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions."
On Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees.
Oversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement.
"The attorney general had been accused of “softening or watering down his report,” Gowdy said, “When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton."
Republicans sought to tie up some loose threads.
The IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system.
Horowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so.
Rep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton.
"“I’ll have to get back to you on that,” Horowitz said, and the IG was “not sure” if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material."
"If the IG did know the subject of the president’s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details."
Horowitz “would have to ask” if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said “not the president himself.”
"Horowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved."
"As for the question of her “intent,” Horowitz said it arose “months earlier,” maybe in 2015, though he couldn’t be sure."
King said President Obama had suggested the “careless but not intentional” language in a “60 Minutes” appearance in October of 2015.
"And King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used “intent” six times."
"Horowitz said Comey “concealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.” The IG also described his report as a “thorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.”"
"The IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team."
Horowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged “tens of thousands of texts.” Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about “we’ll stop” Trump.
"Horowitz conceded that this meant “stop Trump from becoming president.” The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked “why did we not see it until last Thursday?”"
"“I can’t answer that,” Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein’s department at the DOJ."
Jordan concluded that Rosenstein “made the decision that we had to wait a month.”
Several representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named.
"“The FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,” Horowitz said."
"Rep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm."
"“They don’t work in counterintelligence,” said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG “false information” and altered key witness reports."
“How did Comey see the report before it came out?” Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know.
"Horowitz said Comey didn’t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release."
"By the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others."
Horowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok’s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau’s Russia probe.
Also on Tuesday Peter Strzok was “escorted” from the FBI building.
"As his lawyer told reporters, Strzok had “played by the rules,” but been targeted by “unfounded personal attacks, political games and inappropriate information leaks.”"
"“I hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim,” Trey Gowdy told Fox News."
Rep. Bob Goodlatte said the committee would issue a subpoena for Strzok to testify “next week.”
Julian Assange
During World War II Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty was a huge critic of fascism and wound up in prison.
In Oct. 1945 he became head of the Church in Hungary and spoke out just as strongly against Communist oppression.
"He wound up back in prison for eight more years, including long periods of solitary confinement and endured other forms of torture."
"Two weeks after the trial began in early 1949, Pope Pius XII (having failed to speak out forcefully against the Third Reich) did summon the courage to condemn what was happening to Mindszenty."
Pius excommunicated everyone involved in the Mindszenty trial.
"When the Hungarian revolution broke out in 1956, Mindszenty was freed, but only for four days."
"When Soviet tanks rolled back into Budapest, he fled to the U.S. embassy and was given immediate asylum by President Eisenhower."
Speaking Freely: Ray M... Buy New $1.99 (as of 09:20 EDT - Details)
"Mindszenty’s mother was permitted to visit him four times a year, and the communist authorities stationed secret police outside the embassy ready to arrest him should he try to leave."
Sound familiar?
"Decades ago, the U.S. and “civilized world” had nothing but high praise for the courageous Mindszenty."
He became a candidate for sainthood.
And Assange?
A Suppression of Conscience
Pilger adds:
WikiLeaks and 9/11: What if?
"Lately, the two of us have been wondering how things might have been different if there had been a quick, confidential way to get information out.” The WikiLeaks Files: T... WikiLeaks Best Price: $2.50 Buy New $7.00 (as of 05:50 EDT - Details)"
"In 2010, while he was still a free man, the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity gave its annual award to Assange."
The citation read:
"The First Amendment, approved four years later, aimed at ensuring that the press would be free of government interference."
That was then.
"It has been said: “You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.” WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie."
"Last spring, when we chose WikiLeaks and Julian Assange for this award, Julian said he would accept only “on behalf or our sources, without which WikiLeaks’ contributions are of no significance.” We do not know if Pvt."
We hope to have a chance to honor them in person in the future.
"Today we honor WikiLeaks, and one of its leaders, Julian Assange, for their ingenuity in creating a new highway by which important documentary evidence can make its way, quickly and confidentially, through the ether and into our in-boxes."
Eventually a compromise was found in 1971 when Pope Paul VI lifted the excommunications and Mindszenty was able to leave the U.S. embassy.
Can such a diplomatic solution be found to free Assange?
It is looking more and more unlikely with each passing year.

The Obama Era Jade Helm Connection To The Current Illegal Immigration Policy
"On the surface, the latest illegal immigration debate between Leftists and the Administration looks like, yet another issue Progressives are trying to undermine progress being done by the president."
"No one should be surprised by the crackdown on illegals entering the country, especially since it was one of the major campaign promises Donald Trump made before getting elected."
"When it comes to the separation of children from their families, there is nothing new today that was not being done during the Obama reign."
"In 2013, Obama began bringing into the US literally over a hundred thousand people, mainly below age 21."
"They were bused, flown, and met at the US border with Mexico by the Department of Homeland Security under the direction of Obama to do so."
"Since most of them were adolescents and older teenagers they could not be set free, thus Obama ordered various military bases to house these children."

"The surge of children into the US from various countries south of the border was said to be the result of economics, high crime rates, and actual threats from organized crime entities."
"We have only what little information the government told us then, which was not very much, considering the fact that Obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible."
"Many remember the military taking over several Walmart locations, mainly in Texas, during the Jade Helm exercises."
"This, along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years, speaks volumes in the government's plan to be able to handle millions of people."
"Since Obama planned to have over a million Muslim refugees brought into the US over a short period of time, along with the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in, one can understand the reason the Feds had to have the Walmart stores and so much land, as they needed housing for the millions they planned to bring in."
"Despite President Trump signing an Executive Order suspending Syrian refugees from entering the US for 120 days on Jan. 26, 2017 while security measures were reviewed, the US still imported 110,000 refugees from Syria and various other countries into the US in 2017 alone, up from 85,000 the previous year."
These numbers follow Obama's projections of the expected amount of refugees permitted to come to the US.
"Of course, as with the number of illegal immigrants entering our county, the Feds downplay the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number."
What they do not want to admit to is the fact that today's illegal immigration picture is one that follows the Obama plan on dealing with the influx of illegals to a carbon copy.
"The bottom line is, both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to Jade Helm which paved the way for the housing needed for such a huge influx of illegal immigrants and refugees."
All of which seems to be a planned event.
"In any case, neither side in DC is really interested in solving the illegal immigration problem or cares about the children involved."

The twelfth-century Muslim historian Ibn Baydhaq detailed how the Almohads treated the Jews as they advanced:
"Abd al-Mumin…the leader of the Almohads after the death of Muhammad ibn Tumart the Mahdi…captured Tlemcen [in the Maghreb] and killed all those who were in it, including the Jews, except those who embraced Islam…."
[In Sijilmasa] one hundred and fifty persons were killed for clinging to their [Jewish] faith….
All the cities in the Almoravid state were conquered by the Almohads.
"One hundred thousand persons were killed in Fez on that occasion, and 120,000 in Marrakesh."

Who ‘Won’ the Trump-Kim Summit?
That said it all.
"Just out of hospital, I was in no shape to compete with the great Economist or its very witty headline writers."
"Beyond gestures, North Korea’s leader certainly came out ahead."
"His objective – and those of his family predecessors for the past 60 years – was to normalize relations with the US, start trade, and end US efforts to overthrow the Marxist government in Pyongyang."
No more hiding under your school desks or in dank basements.
Korea still has all of its medium and long-ranged missiles and an estimated 40 or more nuclear warheads.
The North is developing submarines that can launch nuclear-armed missiles from underwater off America’s coasts.
"For Kim, these weapons are purely defensive, designed to prevent a US attack on his nation."
But he is now a full-fledged member of the nuclear club.
"Equally important, North Korea still has an estimated 14,000 170mm guns and hundreds of 300mm long-ranged rocket launchers emplaced in caves just north of the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas."
"They threaten almost all of South Korea’s capital Seoul north of the Han River and some US military bases and key airfields, notably Osan."
I have seen these emplacements from the northern edge of the DMZ.
Kim’s big guns hold Seoul’s millions of inhabitants hostage.

There is no mention of this artillery threat in the final communiqué issued by Trump and Kim in Singapore.
This column has been calling for their end for a decade.
North Korea will seemingly halt its missile tests.
This is not the ‘denuclearization’ of North Korea that has been bandied about.
There may be a few gestures of disarmament but Kim must know that his nukes are his means of survival.
"In Asia, preserving ‘face’ is essential."
Japan can deploy nuclear weapons in 3-6 months; South Korea is not far behind.
The United States and North Korea are now on a more civilized level of behavior.
But nothing basic has been resolved.
"Maybe Trump has some more concessions up his sleeve, like cutting the number of US troops in the South."
But Korea is now on the back burner as Trump wages trade wars around the globe.

A secret memo marked “URGENT” detailed how the House Democratic Caucus’s server went “missing” soon after it became evidence in a cybersecurity probe.
The secret memo also said more than “40 House offices may have been victims of IT security violations.”
"In the memo, Congress’s top law enforcement official, Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, along with Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko, wrote, “We have concluded that the employees [Democratic systems administrator Imran Awan and his family] are an ongoing and serious risk to the House of Representatives, possibly threatening the integrity of our information systems and thereby members’ capacity to serve constituents.”"
"The memo, addressed to the Committee on House Administration (CHA) and dated Feb. 3, 2017, was recently reviewed and transcribed by The Daily Caller News Foundation."
The letter bolsters TheDCNF’s previous reporting about the missing server and evidence of fraud on Capitol Hill.
"It details how the caucus server, run by then-caucus Chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra, was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General (IG) identified suspicious activity on it, but the Awans’ physical access was not blocked."
"But after, the report reads, the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar."
"The memo called for firing the Pakistani-born aides, revoking all their computer accounts, and changing the locks on any door they had access to."
Rep. Louie Gohmert — a Texas Republican on the House Committee on the Judiciary who has done oversight work on the case — said the missing server contained copies of Congress members’ emails.
"“They put 40 members of Congress’s data on one server … That server, with that serial number, has disappeared,” he said."
"Multiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF that shortly after an IG report came out identifying the House Democratic Caucus server as key evidence in a criminal probe, the evidence was stolen."
"“They [the Awans] deliberately turned over a fake server” to falsify evidence, one official close to the CHA alleged."
“It was a breach.
The data was completely out of [members’] possession.”
The six-page letter says:
• In September of 2016 … the CHA and [IG] briefed the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus about suspicious activity related to their server that the [IG] identified.
"As a result, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus directed the CAO to copy the data from their server and two computers."
• The CHA directed the IG to refer the matter to the US Capitol Police.
The USCP initiated an investigation that continues to this day.
"• In late 2016, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus announced his intention to resign from Congress to assume a new position."
"The CAO and [sergeant-at-arms] worked with the Chairman to account for his inventory, including the one server."
"• While reviewing the inventory, the CAO discovered that the serial number of the server did not match that of the one imaged in September."
"[Investigators] also discovered that the server in question [the replacement server] was still operating under the employee’s control, contrary to the explicit instructions of the former chairman to turn over all equipment and fully cooperate with the inquiry and investigation."
"[A House source said the ""employee” was Abid Awan.]"
• The USCP interviewed relevant staff regarding the missing server.
"• On January 24, 2017, the CAO acquired the [r[replacement]erver from the control of the employees and transferred that server to the USCP."
President Donald Trump referenced the Democratic Caucus’ missing server in a tweet.
An IG presentation from September 2016 shows that Becerra knew of problems months before the server disappeared.
"“The Caucus Chief of Staff requested one of the shared employees to not provide IT services or access their computers,” it read."
"A House official close to the probe said the employee was Abid, who was not on Becerra or the Caucus’s payroll."
The official said Becerra Chief of Staff Sean McCluskie apparently knew Abid was accessing Caucus servers.
"According to payroll records, Abid’s sister-in-law, Hina Alvi, was the Caucus’ systems administrator."
"The Awans’ continued physical access to Becerra’s equipment after red flags emerged enabled the server to disappear after it became evidence, House officials close to the investigation told TheDCNF."
"(RELATED: Becerra Tried To Block Awan From House Democratic Caucus Server, But Logins Continued; He Didn’t Go To Cops)"
"Becerra has refused to comment, citing an ongoing criminal investigation."
"“These employees accessed user accounts and computers for offices that did not employ them, without the knowledge and permission of the impacted Member’s office,” it said, adding, “4 of the employees accessed the Democratic Caucus computers 5,735 times.” More than 100 office computers were open to access from people not on the office’s staff, it said."
"Chris Gowen — a former aide to Hillary Clinton who is now serving as Imran’s attorney — told TheDCNF, “There is no missing server and never was.”"
"The memo said the CHA possesses voluminous evidence, including, “Interview notes with House Members’ Chiefs of Staff,” and “Logon activity and computer access logs.” Prosecutors have not brought charges."
"The Awans were banned from Congress’s computer network the day the letter was sent, and Kiko held a briefing to convey the message to chiefs of staff for members who employed them."
But Democrats claim they were never told about any of the cybersecurity issues itemized in the urgent memo.
"Rep. Jackie Speier — a California Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who employed Imran and his wife, Hina Alvi — said she never heard of any missing server."
Joaquin Castro of Texas — another Democratic intelligence committee member who employed one of the Awans — told TheDCNF that Kiko never told him of any cybersecurity issues whatsoever and that the Awan probe was instead described as a theft issue.
"Yet even the alleged theft has not resulted in criminal charges — even though the letter also says House authorities have “purchase orders and vouchers” that allegedly show procurement fraud, as well as testimony from a Democratic chief of staff to Rep. Yvette Clarke, who warned of procurement fraud."
"The FBI arrested Imran at the airport in July 2017 for alleged bank fraud that occurred six months prior, and Democrats have since claimed that the case is about nothing but bank fraud."
"Bank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network concurrent with the urgent memo, which did not cite bank fraud."
"Wendy Anderson, a former chief of staff to New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, told House investigators that she suspected that her predecessor, Shelley Davis, was working with Abid on a theft scheme, but Clarke refused to fire Abid until outside investigators got involved, TheDCNF reported."
"Eighteen months after the evidence was recounted in the urgent memo, prosecution appears to have stalled for reasons not publicly explained."
Imran is in court July 3 for a possible plea deal in the bank fraud case.
"Gohmert said the FBI has refused to accept evidence demonstrating alleged House misconduct, and some witnesses with first-hand knowledge say the bureau has not interviewed them."

Texas teen says he had drink thrown at him at Whataburger because he was wearing pro-Trump hat
"The incident, which was captured on video and has since gone viral, reportedly happened Tuesday at one of the burger chain’s restaurants in San Antonio."
“You ain’t supporting s--- n----!” the man is heard saying on camera after tossing a large drink in the direction of the person filming the video.
WARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE: Click here to watch the video.
"The individual, who has not been identified, then walks away while carrying the red hat."
"The man is heard muttering ""b---- a-- motherf------"" as one of the other teens sitting at the table appears stunned."
"Hunter Richard, the 16-year-old teen who says he was wearing the hat, told WOAI that some of his hair was ripped off as the man removed it from his head."
“I just think a conversation about politics is more productive for the entire whole rather than taking my hat and yelling subjective words to me.”
San Antonio police told Fox News on Thursday they had received a complaint and detectives had been assigned to the case.
"Earlier in the day, a police spokesperson said the department hadn't received a report."

"""To be clear, no Whataburger employees were involved or witnessed the incident, and we ask that questions be directed to San Antonio PD as we continue supporting their efforts.”"
The man in the video allegedly was fired from his part-time job at a San Antonio bar after the footage began circulating on social media.
"“It came to our attention earlier this evening that a part-time employee was captured on cell phone video assaulting another person at a local eatery,” the Rumble bar in San Antonio posted on its Facebook page."
"“The assault took place, presumably, because this employee did not agree with the other individual’s political stance."""
"It continued: “We have since terminated this employee, as his actions go against everything that this establishment stands for."

"As the video begins, the man says, “… supporting the president."
"The boy, Hunter Richard, said the man also pulled his hair while taking the hat, according to reports by News4SA."
"I just think a conversation about politics is more productive for the entire whole rather than taking my hat and yelling subjective words to me,” he told the local NBC affiliate."

Here’s what happened:
Where Trump supporters can't even have a meal in peace?
"https://t.co/9g1BSiw8LS — The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle) July 5, 2018"
"The attack took place in a Whataburger restaurant, and the corporation was quick to condemn the man’s actions:"
“We were shocked to see this video and certainly don’t condone this type of customer behavior in our restaurants.
"To be clear, no Whataburger employees were involved or witnessed the incident, and we ask that questions be directed to San Antonio PD as we continue supporting their efforts.”"
"Jimenez, who is 30, seems to have only had a part-time job."
His employer was a San Antonio nightspot called Rumble.
"On their Facebook page, they wrote, “…We have since terminated this employee, as his actions go against everything that this establishment stands for."
"Rumble has, and always will be, a bar that is as inclusive as any establishment could possibly be."
"No matter your race, creed, ethnicity, sexual identity, and political stance, you are welcomed here!” Rumble said on Facebook that Jimenez worked as a “part-time door guy.” They added, “We do not condone these types of actions or behavior."
If you have any questions or concerns please message us privately.
We support and appreciate your business.”
"No, he is further to the Left and was an active member of the Green Party."
"However, upon learning of his behavior the local Green Party told the media that Jimenez had been cut off from the party for his uncalled for attack on a child."
"“You may not like the hat or you may not like the president, but you don’t show that kind of aggression toward teenagers."
It goes against everything the Green Party stands for.
We do not take our aggression out on innocent young people.”
"Some on the right have connected the attack to Maxine Waters’ call for Democrats to confront members of the Trump administration whenever, and wherever they happened to find them."
"Leftists have said the connection is unfair, because Waters’ was only calling for accosting Trump administration officials."
"My question is; how big of a leap would it be for a normal, rational adult to go from confronting administration officials to attacking the people who elected them to power?"
Not much in my mind.

"""What’s wrong with me?"""
I laughingly replied.
This reminds me of when I gave a prayer at the state capital in Minnesota.
"After the prayer was over, I had a minister come up to me and tell me that I could not be dropping the “J” (Jesus) word in the capital."
How true Scripture is when it declares:
"“Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!"""
"They were, in fact, turning the world right side up (Acts 17:6)."

"Last week, I had a woman come up to me at my last meeting in Amery, Wisconsin."
She said that she did her research on me and said that the media really attacked me.

“Doesn’t mean we’re going to do them.”
What President Trump really meant is that he has painted the US into a corner with all his threats of war and really does not know what to do next.
North Korea called his ‘or else’ bluff.
Good.
No action on North Korea is better than any conceivable military operation.
"Last week the North Korea test fired a new, longer-ranged strategic missile, Hwasong-14, that US experts claimed was capable of hitting Alaska and perhaps even San Francisco."
North Korea is now believed to have mastered a lightweight nuclear warhead that can be carried by the Hwasong and shorter-ranged Taepodong and Nodong missiles.

"Half of South Korea’s capitol, Seoul, is within range of North Korean heavy artillery and rocket batteries dug into the so-called Demilitarized Zone."
Why are we even talking about nuclear war in North Asia?
Israel uses the same argument to justify its large nuclear arsenal.
"Almost equally important, North Korea boasts one of the word’s biggest armies – 1,020,000 men, 88,000 crack special forces, and an trained militia of over 5 million."
I’ve been in the deep North Korean-dug tunnels under the Demilitarized Zone.
A full division can be moved through in only 60 minutes.
The Pentagon is not eager to tangle with the tough North Koreans.
"Estimates of the cost of a US invasion of North Korea have run as high as 250,000 US casualties and tens of billions of dollars."
Trump seemed certain he could somehow cajole China into disarming North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.
"But the administration’s amateur foreign policymakers failed to understand that the only “deal” that could get China to disarm the North was by agreeing to remove all US military bases from the region – South Korea, Japan and Guam – and also moving the US Seventh Fleet far from China’s coasts."

"South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, demanded that his nation be consulted before any military action."
But Moon’s pleas have been largely ignored by Trump.
Of course.
They would be the primary victims.
The US has spent over $200 billion on ballistic anti-missile systems in recent years designed to stop North Korean missiles.

"Jean-Clément Jeanbart, the Melkite Greek Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo, gave an interview to a French reporter in which he was highly critical of the mainstream media and even of his fellow bishops for ignoring the Muslim persecution of Middle Eastern Christians."
"“The European media,” he charged, “have not ceased to suppress the daily news of those who are suffering in Syria and they have even justified what is happening in our country by using information without taking the trouble to verify it.” And as for his brother bishops in France, “the conference of French bishops should have trusted us, it would have been better informed."

Strange ‘Sonic Attacks’ Against Diplomats Reach Epic Proportions
It all started in the fall of 2016 when diplomats at the United States Embassy in Cuba reported some hearing loss and mild brain damage after hearing unusual and puzzling sounds.
SHTFPlan originally detailed the symptoms experienced by US diplomats in Cuba back in September of 2017.
"Several of the affected diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of Barack Obama’s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba."
"The Daily Mail reported that one diplomat described being jolted awake in a Havana hotel room by a grinding, blaring cacophony."
"When he moved a few feet across the room, the noise stopped."
"When he got back into bed, the agonizing sound hit him again; as if, he told doctors, he had walked through some invisible wall cutting straight down the middle of his room."
–SHTFPlan
Other embassies have now reported the debilitating conditions of diplomats.
Diplomats in at least seven cities in four different countries have sought testing for strange symptoms.
"The victims’ symptoms include “hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, balance problems, visual difficulties, headaches, fatigue, cognitive issues and sleeping problems.”"
The latest incident occurred in conjunction with President Trump’s recent visit with Kim Jong-Un.
"As Trump was heading to Singapore for the historic summit with North Korea’s leader, a State Department diplomatic security agent who was part of the advanced team reported hearing an unusual sound he believed was similar to what was experienced by U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China who later became ill."
"The government employee experienced the symptoms from late 2017 until April of 2018, according to the U.S. State Department."
“The employee was sent to the United States for further evaluation.
"On May 18, 2018, the Embassy learned that the clinical findings of this evaluation matched mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI),” Jinnie Lee, U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Beijing, told Gizmodo by email."
"“The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures,” Lee continued."
–SHTFPlan
﻿
"And now, some of the strange sounds have been now been recorded and released to the public."
The U.S. government has issued an alert warning Americans traveling to China to seek medical attention if they experience “auditory or sensory phenomena” similar to what was reported in Havana.
"Additionally, the State Department recommended anyone traveling to Cuba should “reconsider” their plans."
Trump pardons Oregon ranchers whose imprisonment sparked 2016 armed standoff
"Dwight Hammond, 76, and Steven Hammond, 49, were originally convicted in 2012 after an Oregon jury found they had committed arson on federal lands a decade earlier."
| Rick Bowmer/AP Photo Trump pardons Oregon ranchers whose imprisonment sparked 2016 armed standoff
"President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued presidential pardons to two Oregon cattle ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, convicted in 2012 of committing arson on federal lands near their ranch."
The father and son's 2016 imprisonment — and the armed protest at a national wildlife refuge that followed — formed a flashpoint in the ongoing dispute between cattle ranchers and the federal government over land-use rights.
Story Continued Below
"“The Hammonds are multi-generation cattle ranchers in Oregon imprisoned in connection with a fire that leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land,” the White House said in a statement."
"“Justice is overdue for Dwight and Steven Hammond, both of whom are entirely deserving of these Grants of Executive Clemency.”"
"Dwight Hammond, 76, and Steven Hammond, 49, were originally convicted in 2012 after an Oregon jury found they had committed arson on federal lands a decade earlier."
"The Hammonds asserted they were taking preventative measures to protect their property from wildfires and invasive plants; the federal government maintained they were attempting to mask illegal deer hunting, among other things."

"After a sympathetic federal judge ruled the 5-year mandatory minimum sentence unconstitutional, the father and son walked away with sentences of three months and one year respectively."
"Prosecutors appealed, and the 9th U.S."
"Circuit Court of Appeals later reversed the decision, resentencing the men to 5 years apiece (a move the White House statement called ""unjust"")."
"The duo’s subsequent arrival at a California prison to complete the remainder of their sentences triggered a 300-person march and later, a protest at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge."
"There, armed occupiers — including Ammon Bundy, whose father Cliven Bundy participated in a similar 2014 standoff — faced off with federal agents for 41 days in dispute of the jail time, which they saw as punishment for the Hammond family’s refusal to sell the government its land."
"“We felt we had exhausted all prudent measures,” Bundy said in a news conference at the time."
"“Do we allow this to go on, or do we make a stand?”"
"The Hammonds’ attorneys had sought clemency from former President Barack Obama, The Oregonian reported."
But the appeal did not gain much traction until Trump took office.

"The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds’ responsibility for the fire was conflicting, and the jury acquitted them on most of the charges."
"As a result, the judge imposed significantly lesser sentences."

The same administration that was against mandatory minimums for its drug dealers and gang members went to court to defend mandatory minimums under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.

"Ex-Sailor Pardoned By Trump, Sues Obama And Comey For NOT Prosecuting Hillary"
The former Navy sailor pardoned by President Donald Trump after serving a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of his submarine filed a lawsuit on Monday against Obama administration officials.
The ex-sailor is alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law and cites Comey and Obama’s willingness to not prosecute Hillary Clinton.
"Barack Obama and former FBI director James Comey let Hillary off the hook before the election, while Kristian Saucier served hard time."
Saucier says that that action was “unfair” and “unequal” compared to the corruption and criminal activity of Hillary Clinton.
"Saucier’s lawsuit names as defendants former President Barack Obama, former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who led the inquiry into Clinton’s email account."
"“I could have just taken the pardon by President Trump and gone on with my life,” Saucier said to Fox News, adding that he feels an obligation to get to the truth of what he sees as a double standard that let Clinton get off scot-free."
"“The U.S. Constitution clearly states that all citizens are born with inalienable rights to be free from persecution by the government,” Saucier said."
"The former Navy sailor is acting as his own attorney after the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court New York barred his lawyer, Ronald Daigle, from practicing for one year."
"The court’s move came just as Daigle was helping Saucier prepare to file the lawsuit, prompting the navy sailor to accuse New York officials of trying to hinder his court fight against Obama, Comey, and others."
–Fox News
"Saucier said that he realizes he had erred in taking the photos of the submarine, which he said he wanted to show only to his family so that they could see where he worked."
"He has also lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton’s emails."

French Jewish woman’s killer found unfit to stand trial in 2nd evaluation
"The suspect in the alleged murder of a Jewish physician in Paris was not responsible for his actions, a second psychiatric evaluation has determined, contradicting an earlier assessment."
"The president of the CRIF umbrella of French Jewish communities protested the court’s decision to revisit the issue of suitability to stand trial of Kobili Traore, which the court pursued on its own initiative and not at the request of his defense."
"In January, Traore was determined to be fit to stand trial."
He was placed in a psychiatric hospital for weeks after his arrest in the April 2017 killing of Sarah Halimi despite having no history of mental illness.

"But a judge requested a second series of tests, which determined that the Malian immigrant was not able to stand trial, 20 Minutes reported Wednesday."
A third evaluation will follow before the court finally reaches a decision.
"An aggravated element of a hate crime was added to Traore’s indictment following vocal protests by CRIF, which said that the omission of such charges may have part of a “cover up” by French authorities."
This just continues the pattern.
I wrote about the murder of Sarah Halimi last year.
She died on the street outside the building where she had lived for thirty years.
"The killer had allegedly shouted, “Allahu Akbar”."
"And, predictably, the killer gets a pass."
"In January, Traore was determined to be fit to stand trial."
He was placed in a psychiatric hospital for weeks after his arrest in the April 2017 killing despite having no history of mental illness.
"But a judge requested a second series of tests, which determined that the Malian immigrant was not able to stand trial, 20 Minutes reported Wednesday."
Then they were dropped.
Now they're letting him get away with it.
"Three minutes later, a unit of the Anti-Crime Brigade (BAC) — who happened to be patrolling the area — took up position in front of Diara’s door."
They heard Kobili Traore chanting Muslim prayers and Koranic verses.
"Unsure about the situation and the potential threats to the family, they asked for reinforcements."
Additional policemen arrived quickly.
"However, for some unclear reason, the BAC unit still refrained from breaking in."
"In the meantime, Kobili Traore put on new clothes and climbed out of the window to reach Sarah Halimi’s apartment, which was at the same level as Diara Traore’s."
From time to time he resumed Koranic recitation.
Yet the police still failed to storm Sarah Halimi’s apartment and rescue her.
"Eventually, Kobili Traore is claimed to have shouted that the woman was “mad and about to commit suicide”, and threw her out of the window."
He had time enough to climb back to Diara Traore’s apartment where he finally was arrested.
His hands were covered in blood.
There was blood everywhere in his victim’s apartment.
So crazy he tried to contrive an alibi for his crime.
But the system that keeps on protecting him is.
﻿
Jimenez was later arrested and shortly thereafter fired from his job for ripping off Richard’s hat and stealing it.
Jimenez also threw a soda in Richard’s face.
"Among those who commented on the video’s original posting was Donald Trump Jr., who retweeted a story about the assault against the teenager."
!” he wrote on Twitter.
If someone can get me this young man’s information I’ll get him a new #maga hat… SIGNED by #potus!!!

Richard told media outlets that he’s been a bit surprised by everything that’s happened since the video was posted online.
"“I didn’t think it was going to generate the amount like what people are doing, I was looking at the comments by some people and ‘they are like this is uncalled for’ and other people are like mixed opinions but I didn’t think it would blow up to what it is now,” he said to News-4 San Antonio."
"FIVE YEARS AGO, 25-year-old radical libertarian Cody Wilson stood on a remote central Texas gun range and pulled the trigger on the world’s first fully 3-D-printed gun."
"When, to his relief, his plastic invention fired a .380-caliber bullet into a berm of dirt without jamming or exploding in his hands, he drove back to Austin and uploaded the blueprints for the pistol to his website, Defcad.com."
Defend Yourself: A Com...
"In the days after that first test-firing, his gun was downloaded more than 100,000 times."
"Wilson made the decision to go all in on the project, dropping out of law school at the University of Texas, as if to confirm his belief that technology supersedes law."
The law caught up.
"He took Defcad.com offline, but his lawyer warned him that he still potentially faced millions of dollars in fines and years in prison simply for having made the file available to overseas downloaders for a few days."
…
"Two months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government."
"Wilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim: They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D-printable data, the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information."
"By blurring the line between a gun and a digital file, Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First."

"“If code is speech, the constitutional contradictions are evident,” Wilson explained to WIRED when he first launched the lawsuit in 2015."
"The Department of Justice’s surprising settlement, confirmed in court documents earlier this month, essentially surrenders to that argument."
"It promises to change the export control rules surrounding any firearm below .50 caliber—with a few exceptions like fully automatic weapons and rare gun designs that use caseless ammunition—and move their regulation to the Commerce Department, which won’t try to police technical data about the guns posted on the public internet."
"In the meantime, it gives Wilson a unique license to publish data about those weapons anywhere he chooses."
"“I consider it a truly grand thing,” Wilson says."
DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment
"The Trump DOJ settled with Wilson, finally acknowledging that his 3D print gun files are protected as free speech under the First Amendment."
"I first reported that 3-D guns were for real back in July of 2012, when an internet gunsmith by the name of ""Have Blue"" produced an AR style pistol that fired both .22 and .223 caliber bullets."
"Later, Cody Wilson, 25, a law student at the University of Texas and founder of the non-profit group Defense Distributed, had produced a 3-D printed handgun made entirely of ABS plastic with only a metal firing pin."

"In 2013, Wilson had the information on how to build the gun removed from public access at the request of the United States Department of Defense Trade Controls."
"According to Wilson, they seized control of the information."
"So, what did he do?"
"He fired them, and got a new legal team."
Wired has the story.
"In doing so, he has now not only defeated a legal threat to his own highly controversial gunsmithing project."
"Two months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government."

"""I consider it a truly grand thing,"" Wilson says."
The Second Amendment Foundation has issued the following press release:
"BELLEVUE, WA – The Department of Justice and Second Amendment Foundation have reached a settlement in SAF’s lawsuit on behalf of Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over free speech issues related to 3-D files and other information that may be used to manufacture lawful firearms."
"Under terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue."
"The government has also agreed to pay a significant portion of the plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees, and to return $10,000 in State Department registration dues paid by Defense Distributed as a result of the prior restraint."
"Significantly, the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military."
"“For years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called ‘weapons of war,’ and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort."
"“Under this settlement,” he continued, “the government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case."
"They will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech."
"That will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.” The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation’s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms."
"Founded in 1974, The Foundation has grown to more than 600,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control."
What does all this mean?
Why?
"Because now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered."
"That's right, and it's perfectly legal to do so."
And we aren't just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun.
"We're talking ARs, 1911s and a host of other guns."
"This actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future, as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores."
"I don't know that I would go quite that far, after all, the settlement does state that ""the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military."""
"Therefore, the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms, which it does not have authority to do."
"""This doesn’t put the rifle in everyone’s hand, but it does that in essence"" he added."
As Joe Wolverton of The New American writes:
"Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama"
"In his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki."
"The president said: “It should have been obvious – I thought it would be obvious – but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn’t."
"In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of “wouldn’t.” The sentence should have been: I don’t see any reason why I wouldn’t – or why it wouldn’t be Russia."
"So just to repeat it, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t’ …"
Anyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake.
His natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes.
"For him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one)."
"President Trump said: “President Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now – probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks – they knew about Russia’s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it."
It turned out it didn’t happen that way.
There are two key facts in this statement.
It was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s.
"Second, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being."
"Also, President Trump’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy."
"Furthermore, President Trump’s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin."
President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.
More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.
Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.
We are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing.
"With President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked."
"In fact, the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice."
"Whatever the Russians did, they did while Brennan was director of the CIA, Clapper was director of national intelligence, and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
Just keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV.
"My prediction is that President Trump will remain tough on Russia, and the Helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was."
"Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the first his Cromwell; And George the third- Treason!"
"If this be treason, make the most of it."
–Patrick Henry
He went onto say that we are commanded by Scripture to submit to the authorities that have been elected.

"“Resistance to tyranny becomes the Christian duty of each individual… Continue steadfast and, with a proper sense of your dependence on God, nobly defend those rights which Heaven gave, and no man ought to take from us.” (History of the United States of America, Volume."
2 p. 229)
They sacrificed themselves to establish the freedoms in which he enjoys today.
"First of all, the authority given to our representative government is derived from “We the People.”"
"We receive our rights from God, and in turn, delegate power to those who serve “We the People.”"
"“They are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights… Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their powers from the consent of the governed.” -The Declaration of Independence"
He then quotes Romans 13: 1-7
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil."
Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?
"do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:"
For he is the minister of God to thee for good.
"Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake."
"For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing."
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
The first Scripture says:
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
"God ordained the power, and that “rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil."""
Did God tell His Church to submit to that which He condemns?
"Is the Church to transgress His Laws, or to magnify and enforce His Laws unto judgment?"
"If He did, that would make God unjust."
"Jesus said, ""Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil” (Matthew 5:17)."
"The Lord has, in fact, commanded nowhere in Scripture for the Church to submit to the wicked."
The Bible teaches just the exact opposite.
"Furthermore, it would contradict what Scripture teaches us from Genesis all the way to Revelation every step of the way."
"They are appointed to magnify law against crime, not crime against the law (Psalm 94:20)."
"America is based on Common Law, the Mosaic Institution."
Read the 5 books of Moses.
Submit to what God condemns?
Did Christian martyrs violate God’s principles of submission to authority?
"Also, keep in mind that magistrates have limited and defined authority in civil matters."
"God never gave them that authority and any, and all, government that oversteps the divine authority and its boundaries has no divine authority or protection."
Civil government is a “minister for God to thee for good” (Romans 13:4).
It is not a minister of God for evil.
Common sense does come into play here.
"And when Pharaoh refused, God plagued the Pharaoh and the Egyptians and set His children free."
Is this what is being preached from the pulpits across America today?
Or what of Gideon who was to deliver the Children of Israel from the Midianites?
The first thing the Lord commanded him to do was to tear down his father's altars (Judges 6:25).
Was this a violation of God's principles of submission?
The sins of the fathers were the reason the Midianites had power to oppress them.
"What of that lone prophet, Elijah?"
"Elijah took Ahab and the false prophets to the top of Mount Carmel where the God of Israel consumed the sacrifice by fire, and the false prophets were killed (1 Kings 18:38-40)."
What of King David?
Was he violating God’s principles of submission when he refused to surrender himself to Saul’s troops?
David was a king that was to overthrow corrupt governments by dispossessing them and establishing righteousness through justice and judgment (Jeremiah 23:5; Isaiah 51:4).
"Did Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego violate God's principle of submission when they refused to worship King Nebuchadnezzar’s image?"
"Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
"That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:"
Daniel 3:3-6
"“Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.” Daniel 3:28"
Did Daniel violate God's principles of submission when he disobeyed the king's order to stop praying to any god but himself?
Keep in mind that the punishment was that Daniel was thrown into a den of lions in which God sent forth an angel to protect him.
His accusers were then thrown into the den and devoured by the very lions that they meant to have devoured Daniel (Daniel 6).
What of Jeremiah?
Was he violating God's principles of submission when he was sent to preach repentance to the corrupt church and the corrupt kings?
"For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land."
Jeremiah 1:18
"Was that violating, or fulfilling God's principles and purposes?"
What of the New Testament?
Was this a violation of submission to civil government?
"No, it was a rebuke to corruption in government to submit to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and His laws."
"Is it a violation of submission to God's principles to keep preaching, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins…”?"
"“Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
"And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide."
Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem."
"And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?"
"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,"
"Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole."
"This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner."
"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
"And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."
"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"
"Saying, What shall we do to these men?"
for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
"But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name."
"And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus."
"But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."
For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” Acts 4:2-20
“Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
"And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also."
(Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
"And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people."
Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
"And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison."
"And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly."
And his chains fell off from his hands.
"And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals."
And so he did.
"And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me."
"And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision."
"When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him."
"And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.”"
as well as those who submitted to such.
"It is important for people to know the Scriptures (History), lest you find yourselves to be fighting against God (Acts 5:39)."
Nowhere in Scripture can you find the Lord telling His children to submit to the wicked in disobedience to His Word.
"“Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.”"

"The most downloads came from Spain, followed by the U.S., Brazil and Germany."
"Within days of the gun file being uploaded, the Obama State Department served Wilson with a letter threatening criminal prosecution for violating federal export controls."
"Wilson immediately complied with the order, but there was no way to stop further downloading."
"Within a week of the initial uploading, the file could be downloaded on the Internet from over 4,000 different computers around the world."
"In 2015, the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) and DD sued the State Department, arguing that ""sharing instructions on how to make guns with 3D printers counts as constitutionally protected speech."
"This is an important victory for First Amendment rights."""
"The Justice Department’s recent settlement with Wilson is very favorable to him, allowing Wilson to provide the printing instructions “for public release (meaning unlimited distribution) in any form.” The government also compensated $40,000 of Wilson’s legal costs."
How the government will stop people from obtaining these printers isn’t exactly obvious.
"Proposals to require background checks, mandatory serial numbers and even a registration process for printers are easily defeated."
"Even if printers are registered with the government, what is going to stop gangs from stealing them?"
And the designs for making your own printer have been available on the Internet for years.
"Many parts of a gun can be made on very inexpensive, plastic 3D printers or even from simple machine tools."
"That isn’t too surprising, as drug gangs are the source of both illegal drugs and guns."
"This was a tough battle for the plaintiff's, SAF and DD."
They lost many lower court rulings.
The concept of making guns with 3D printers in an age where just one year can render much technology obsolete shouldn't surprise anyone.
Nor should the fact that instructions for gun assembly are easily available for download over the internet.
"At the click of a mouse, we can summon almost any information we could possibly need including instructions for making a bomb."
Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”
"Well, it’s been quite a couple of news weeks for the Catholic Church, hey?"
"McCarrick, Pineda/Maradiaga, Fr."
The anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call “the good bishops”.
It’s clear that even the “good bishops” have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.
"We are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years."
The McCarrick news – and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga – has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it.
Rod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang.
"It has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one “bad apple” or even only a “few” as the hapless “conservative” Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter."
This is the result of a mass-collusion.
"As our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, “We’ve got to stop pretending it’s just the progressive element in the Church."
"The ‘conservatives’ are complicit, too.” In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm."
"Whether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the “New Church.”"
"In briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2]."
"When that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control."
This is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.
"As Dreher reported,"
"Gay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex."
"If they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared… And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered."
"Later, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles."
"When I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men — priests, former priests, seminarians — who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger."
Nothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.
"For many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least."
I’ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.
How are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation?
Where are they to live?
How are they to maintain themselves?
"As men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs."
"In short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest’s material life."
"The bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless."
"And these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical."
"Moreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world."
"And with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate."
He will remain a pariah even among the so-called “good” bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal… (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush/John Paul II.)
"I have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, “We’re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don’t we’ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we’ll be homeless and penniless."
Many priests are getting older – many of them with health issues – and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.
Of course there are some who don’t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.
"Some of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives."
But I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.
"I think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end."
"As one of them said to me, “The old arrangement was, ‘Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you."
So what do we do?
The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.
"As we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started."
It’s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.
We need to start working together with faithful priests – while there still are some – to help them create practical material alternatives.
"If we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it."
"The other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it’s time we all started taking seriously."
"In response to the continued outrages of both “good” and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing “an escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.”"
I responded: “And the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.
"We could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.”"
I am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.
"This would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff."
"I started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]"
I responded that this was going about things the wrong way.
"Catholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, “begging” the hierarchy to maintain the Faith."
"First of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy."
"Let’s not give them that, OK?"
There’s already enough “frissons of pleasure” in their lives.
"Second, it’s simply not going to work."
They’ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church.
They know it and it’s time we stopped imagining otherwise.
The other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.
There’s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.
No one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he’s a faithful Catholic.
We should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner.
He should own a house or stand to inherit one.
Families have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.
"And more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood."
Among the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work.
But most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on.
How many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?
Change the oil in a car?
Rewire a house?
The standard cliché of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it’s not even worth memeing anymore.
How many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong “sexual orientation”?
"Every one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills."
"Among the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree."
That’s an economic asset that we can’t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.

It reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations.
One kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first.
"This college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap."
"This is fine, good idea."
But I asked him what he knew how to do.
“Can you fix a bathroom pipe?
Do you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow?
"Can you drive a tractor?” This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else."
There is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions.
Does a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology?
"Wouldn’t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor?"
"Or for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker?"
"If you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska."
I think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.
"Young men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day."
"Simply put, they’ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy."
This vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time.
"The next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I’m going to ask, “How sound is your investment portfolio?” The next candidate for religious life, I’ll ask, “Great!"
What’s your trade?
What do you have to fall back on?”
"I’m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we’re seeing elsewhere doesn’t sound like a bad idea."
Perhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.
"Meanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it."
That monastery in Germany is lost.
Those bishops want the property and they’ll get it.
"What the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment."
Bishops won’t protect and support good priests?
"The Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern?"
We’re not helpless.
We start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.
"Our goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life."
I am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.
"They took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world."
Over a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.
"Two trains got away to safety, but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege."
The museum’s website tells us:
"“Despite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions."
"With only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain."
"Equipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area."
"Twelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.” “Hermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles."
No items were lost during the evacuation.”
"To keep up everyone’s morale, the museum staff, while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving, continued to give tours and lectures, describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed."
"They understood the value of what they had, and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it."
"Does this all sound a bit, well, schismatic?"
Not necessarily.
But we’d be fools to wait for them.
"Whatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre’s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the “state of emergency” for which he was preparing has come at last."
"And in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended."
The simple fact is that soon there are going to be “vagus” priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith.
"There are going to be nuns and monks without homes, as in the England of Henry VIII."
I think it’s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can.
What we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and “beg” bishops to maintain and defend the Faith.
It’s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith.
"Sentiment isn’t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills, no money, no job, (no health insurance) and no prospects."
Let’s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it.

"[1] Dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored, one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis’ Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin."
"It should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a “difference of opinion” with the group’s leadership, Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ."
"He joined in 1966, was ordained in ’78, and was quickly appointed to a high-ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy, Spain and Ireland until 1983."
This period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr.
"Maciel, for whom it has been shown ALL the Legion’s leadership was covering."
"The Farrell family’s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother, Bishop Brian Farrell, who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable-but-officially-reformed community in 2015."
A recent post to the official Regnum Christi website shows that Cardinal Kevin is still close enough to the Legion-related “lay” organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks.
"After he left the Legion, Kevin Farrell joined the diocesan clergy in Washington DC and became a protégé of the archbishop, Cardinal Wuerl."
"So close is he to McCarrick that Farrell’s coat of arms, as Elizabeth Yore reported in these pages, is not much more than a tribute to his belatedly-disgraced mentor."
"So, someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too."
"[2] It should also be noted that in his book, The Dictator Pope, historian Henry Sire documented that this is how Jorge Bergoglio has always operated, collecting bad men around him and controlling them with a masterful combination of threats and rewards."
"The natural question, “Why does Pope Francis keep such bad men around him?” is now easy to answer."
"French Authorities Blame Attack by Muslim Shouting, ""Allahu Akbar"" on ""Excitement"""
And outside it.
It can't be a case of Muslim Judeophobia.
(That would be Islamophobic.)
"And since we're in Europe, it's time to default to the standard excuse, mental illness, current flavor, over-excitement."
The police quickly intervened to save the victim who lodged a complaint.
"The anti-Semitic attacker was arrested and placed in police custody and then transferred to the psychiatric infirmary, on the recommendation of the doctor because of his observed state of excitement."
It's okay.
"Earlier this month, the suspect in the alleged murder of a Jewish physician in Paris was deemed not responsible for his actions in a second psychiatric evaluation ordered by a judge even though the defense did not request it."
"The suspect, Traore Kobili, is scheduled to have a third evaluation to determine his ability to stand trial for the murder of Sarah Halimi in April 2017."
The German authorities came to the inescapable conclusion that the attack had nothing to do with Islam.
And in Russia.
I hate democracy.
I am a terrorist.
And Amsterdam.
"On the loose, Malek cut a man’s throat."
He also stabbed two others.
The police stood by and watched until he was done.
And then they arrested him.

Obama Was Never As Tough On Russia As Trump
The media has been hanging on every word the President says and arguing that his rhetoric is proof positive that he is some kind of Russian mole.
The only problem with this thesis?

Here’s The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway explaining:
Our relationship with Russia is at a significant low point where just having some conversations can lead us to a better outcome.
"And there are so many important things that they are involved with that we care about, whether it’s Syria, Ukraine, North Korea or nuclear arms."
I’m kind of surprised there’s been this much angst over this press conference.
Not that he said things the way he should have.
President Trump really did mess up with that press conference but I don’t quite know what people want.
"And in the last couple of years, we’ve seen an increase in the military budget, we’ve seen an increase in the intelligence budget."
We are doing NATO exercises in the Baltics.
We provided legal aid to Ukraine and Georgia.
We’re developing low-yield nuclear weapons.
He implemented sanctions that were even stronger than required by Congressional mandate.
People are obsessed about words and they should maybe focus on the actions as well.
"Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, concurred with Hemingway arguing that by any standard Trump has been far tougher on Russia than Obama was."
It was their duty in 2016 – not candidate Trump’s.
"Also, President Trump’s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy."
"The stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has."
President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.
More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.
Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.

Here’s the crux of Greenwald’s argument:
So let me just make two points.
"Number one is, if you look at President Obama versus President Trump, there’s no question that President Obama was more cooperative with and collaborative with Russia and the Russian agenda than President Trump."
"President Trump has bombed the Assad forces in Syria, a client state of Putin, something that Obama refused to do because he didn’t want to provoke Putin."
"Trump undid the Iran deal, which Russia favored, while Obama worked with Russia in order to do the Iran deal."
Tom Clancy novels but isn’t borne out by the facts.
"The other issue that I want to make is that, you know, again, this idea that somehow that you are endorsing the repression of other countries’ leaders if you meet with them—it is true that Trump has never criticized Putin, although he has taken all the steps I just outlined against Putin."
"It is true President Trump likes fascist and authoritarian leaders, and that is a problem, but it’s not like Putin is the only leader that he doesn’t criticize."
The relevant portion of the debate begins about 21 minutes into the video:

Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran
"On August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported, “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim."
But it wasn’t true.
"In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world."

"In 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House."
"But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed."
"Tom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”"
"If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did."
"Sadly, the United States has a tendency to repeat the same mistakes over and over again."
"And now, a US Army Colonel is predicting that another Gulf of Tonkin incident could bring us into war with Iran."
"The rhetoric is becoming so strong, that Trump himself — without provocation — began tweeting threats to the sovereign nation."
"On Tuesday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Colonel Douglas Macgregor addressed the growing prospect of US war with Iran and warned that a new “Gulf of Tonkin incident” could be used to drag us into it."
“Let’s hope that he understands exactly what’s going on.”
"Pointing out Trump’s recent attempts at diplomacy with North Korea and Russia, Col. Macgregor weighed in, noting that he thinks Trump will attempt to avoid war with Iran."
"However, he noted that a false flag could be used to drag us into it."
"“I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,” Col. Macgregor said."
“Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.
"We should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotage by fake news.”"
Carlson then pointed out how the Trump admin has reacted to fake news by attacking Syria—twice.
"For those who may be unaware, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works."
"In fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009."
MEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime.
They are hardly quiet about it.
"According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009."
"Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N."
Ambassador John Bolton.
"Coincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies—during this training period—until they suddenly removed them from the list in 2012."
"To those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report."
"This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense."
"“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said."
"“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”"
All presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.
Now it’s Trump’s turn.

PEOPLE WHO are barred from purchasing firearms or want to own a gun that is illegal in the jurisdiction where they live may soon have an easy way to get around the law.
All they would need to do is download a computer file and use a 3-D printer to stamp out a gun.
No serial number would allow police to trace a weapon used in a crime.
And there would be no problem getting past metal detectors with a gun molded from high-quality plastic.
"The case involves Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed, who sued the government in 2015 after the State Department under the Obama administration made him take down do-it-yourself gunmaking blueprints he had posted online, saying they violated export regulations governing military hardware and technology."
"But he lost at every stage of litigation, including a refusal by the Supreme Court to review a decision that the code could not be published during the course of the lawsuit."
"In addition to signing off on the public release of the 3-D printing tutorials, the State Department also agreed to pay nearly $40,000 of Mr. Wilson’s legal fees."
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was pressed about the issue Wednesday during his appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Mr. Pompeo promised to “take a look at it.”
That’s not enough.

"For 60 years, Ted McCarrick roamed the halls of seminaries, harassing, raping, and assaulting young males around the world."
His brother bishops all knew and they all stayed silent.
Bergoglio was their man.
"The now well known McCarrick Villanova Speech on October 13, 2013 where he relayed the story about a prominent Italian man who met with McCarrick to ask him to lobby for the election of Bergoglio to the papacy."
"In light of the McCarrick scandal, the conversation takes on new meaning..."
where I was staying.
No one has mentioned his name.
He isn’t on anyone’s mind.
"If you gave him 5 years, he could get us back on target."
He’s 76.
"If he had 5 years—the Lord working through him, he could make the Church over again."

"Oh, the irony!"
"The rallying cry for his homosexual modern agenda was sounded in his July 29, 2013 airplane presser."
Who am I to judge set the tone for merciful embrace of homosexual priests.
"After 5 long years, his unrelenting mercy mantra seemingly extends only to homosexual clerics, not to the laity or clergy victims who protest the cover ups by prelates."
"Francis’ wink and nod to the homosexual lifestyle landed him on the cover of the Advocate, the gay magazine, as its Man of the Year."
He lapped up the accolades from the secular culture and main stream media.
"In the words of Queen Elizabeth, this year has been annus horribilis for Francis."
"Excuse the gay slang pun but, the chickens have come home to roost."
The cascading revelations of papal sex scandals are toppling the barque of Peter.
Will Catholic laity pay attention and take action?
"This critical time in the history of the Catholic Church demands that the laity step forward to protect the Church, its children and seminarians from predators."
"The first order of business is to scuttle the upcoming October Synod on Young People, the Faith, and Vocational Discernment."
"This Synod is designed to exploit the youth, like they’ve been doing for the last 60 years."
"Furthermore, this nightmare of a “sinod"" is inviting youth from ages 16-29 to mingle with the Bishops to discuss the Church, faith and vocations."
The Bishops have proven that they cannot be trusted to protect young people and seminarians from predators.
The ever growing global list of Bishops and Cardinals that have preyed on /and or covered up the sexual abuse of minors and seminarians over the last 60 years continues to enrage the laity.
"We are no longer Shocked, just fed up."
"Let’s start with the Cardinal who will lead the upcoming Synod, none other than Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Prefect of the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life."
"Undoubtedly, Farrell as the head of this Synod chose his dear friend gay friendly, Fr."
"James Martin, S.J."
to keynote the Synod.
exposes his obvious underlying homosexual agenda and aura of the upcoming Synod:
"“A welcome and much-needed book that will help bishops, priests, pastoral associates, and all church leaders more compassionately minister to the LGBT community."
"It will also help LGBT Catholics feel more at home in what is, after all, their church.”"
"What merciful praise for Martin’s book, Cardinal Farrell!"
"Contrary to the theme of mercy and compassion to LGBTs, it appears that your mentor, McCarrick set out to groom and grow an LGBT community."
"Clearly, you and Fr."
Martin have much in common since you both claimed you were “shocked” by the McCarrick allegations.
Explain to Catholics why would you headline a homosexual affirming speaker at a Synod for youth and seminarians?
"In case you haven’t been reading the McCarrick headlines or noticing the plunging mass attendance and collections, Catholics don’t trust their boys around priests and are furious that their seminarians are subjected to unrelenting homosexual sexual harassment."
McCarrick is the last straw.
The October Synod is yet another example of Church leaders exploiting Catholic youth for their own personal power agenda and selfish motives.
Bergoglio’s five year plan is nearly complete.
Catholics must shed their trust and naivety in the papacy and bishops’ conference.
"Dare, if you will, to read the thrill, the excitement and anticipated results of the Synod in the radical New Ways Gay Catholic Ministry article, entitled, Youth Synod Document shows Vatican evolution on LGBT Topics."
The article highlights the New Ways excitement over the shift in the Vatican approach to the LGBT issues at the Synod:
“Another significant development is the acknowledgement that LGBT people have a desire to be part of the church.
"In one section, the document states: “some LGBT youth … wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care from the Church.” “This acknowledgement is a welcome change from the hierarchy’s traditional rhetoric that suggests LGBT people are opposed to religion."
"As New Ways Ministry knows from over 40 years of pastoral work with the LGBT community, LGBT Catholics have a deep spirituality, often forged by remarkable journeys overcoming rejection, alienation, and marginalization."
"LGBT Catholics have stayed a part of the church, despite statements and actions which have offended and hurt them.”"
The New Ways article highlights the efforts of Cardinal Kevin Farrell and his Vatican cronies to promote the LGBT agenda for the upcoming Synod:
"“A third development is that the document shows that Vatican officials paid attention to concerns about LGBT issues which were raised by youth at a pre-synod meeting in Rome during March of this year, and also from youth around the world who made their views known to the Vatican online.”"
"Lest there be any doubt about the secret agenda and outcome of this Synod, Cardinal Baldisseri raises the exclusion rainbow flag."
"Baldisseri notes that the upcoming Synod is to “make the entire Church aware of its important mission to accompany every young person, none excluded.”"
"This papacy is awash in the prissy, pop psycho speak, jargon of accompaniment, listening, and dialogue dazzling the media with empty tropes and luring the uncatechized into its globalist mantra of one world new age religion."
"Welcome to the dumbing down of the Catholic Faith by the St. Gallen Mafia and their don, Jorge Bergoglio."
"This Synod will exploit the youth and seminarians, just like Ted McCarrick."
The handwriting is all over the 37 foot Vatican wall.
The time to take a stand against this radical hijacking of Holy Mother Church is now.
It has all the markings of a Gay Pride Rally.

"Sessions, who was a Trump campaign adviser and the first sitting senator to endorse his candidacy, recused himself from the Russia probe in March 2016 because he expected the campaign to be one focus of the investigation."
"That gave the reins to his deputy Rod Rosenstein, who later appointed Mueller."

President Donald Trump has taken to Twitter in order to call upon Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the investigation into his alleged Russian collusion.
"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018"
"Many Twitter users have taken his side, while many others believe firmly in the Russian conspiracy theory."
The president made his comments in a series of Tweets earlier this morning.
“FBI Agent Peter Strzok (on the Mueller team) should have recused himself on day one.
He needed an insurance policy.
"Those are illegal, improper goals, trying to influence the Election."
.....remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated.
This is a real issue.
It won’t go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys.
"Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.” ALAN DERSHOWITZ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018"
"Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) August 1, 2018"
Attorney General Sessions recused himself from overseeing the investigation early in 2017.
"The New York Times hypothesized that this was done, in part, to avoid the kind of conflicts such as that which Trump has proposed."
"Later, a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed to carry out the investigation."
"Trump’s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Jay A. Sekulow, said in a telephone interview that the president was not ordering the inquiry closed but simply expressing his opinion via the social media platform."
"“It’s not a call to action,” Mr. Giuliani said, adding that it was a sentiment that Mr. Trump and his lawyers have expressed publicly before."
"“He’s expressing his opinion, but he’s not talking of his special powers he has” as president, Giuliani said."
"“He doesn’t feel that he has to intervene in the process, nor is he intervening,” said Sekulow."
The special counsel is also looking into some of Trump’s tweets about Attorney General Sessions and the former F.B.I.
director James Comey and whether the messages were intended to “obstruct the inquiry” into his alleged Russian collusion.
"Senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont, suggested on Twitter that the president’s directive to Sessions in these recent Tweets was, in fact, obstruction."
"When I was a prosecutor, obstruction of justice was often hard to prove, requiring difficult-to-obtain evidence that the individual’s actions were truly intended to interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation."
"https://t.co/CjSFJmng7Z — Sen. Patrick Leahy (@SenatorLeahy) August 1, 2018"
The ongoing battle against the Trump presidency and the debate over what constitutes opinion vs. “obstruction of justice” doesn’t appear to have an end date in sight.
"Although, according to Guiliani, Mueller suggested that the Russia obstruction probe would be wrapping up by September 1."
"Trump calls on Sessions to stop Mueller’s Russia probe, raising specter of attempted obstruction"
Trump is already reportedly under investigation for potential obstruction of the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.
"They were likely prompted by the start of the trial on Tuesday of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, on 18 charges of tax evasion, bank fraud and conspiracy."
“Where is the Russian Collusion?” Trump added.
"“The President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated,” Schiff tweeted."
"Although the White House has said that Trump’s tweets are official presidential statements, his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, responded to the latest one as he has before, by brushing off suggestions that Trump’s tweets could be used as evidence of obstruction."
"“The president was expressing his opinion on his favored medium for asserting his First Amendment right of free speech,” Giuliani said in an interview."
"“He said ‘should,’ not ‘must,’ and no presidential order was issued or will be.”"
He said he spoke with Trump to make sure that the president wasn’t actually issuing an order.
"“I talked to him about it to make sure he was on the same page as we are,” Giuliani said, and the president indicated he was not ordering Sessions to act."
"On Sunday, Giuliani told CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “Obstruction by tweet is not something I think works real well."
"Generally obstruction is secret, it’s clandestine, it’s corrupt.”"
"For months, Trump’s lawyers also have argued that it’s impossible for the president to obstruct justice because his constitutional authority extends over the Justice Department."
"That power allows him to direct officials where to focus their resources or to fire them when he chooses, as Trump did when removing James B. Comey as FBI director last year."
"That firing, however, led to Mueller’s appointment as special counsel."
"He announced the decision after controversy over his own undisclosed contacts, both during the campaign and the post-election transition, with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak."
But Dershowitz also cast doubt on whether Trump’s tweets can be seen as an act of obstruction.
"“You cannot obstruct justice by openly exercising your First Amendment rights and openly criticizing a prosecution, whether you’re right or wrong,” he said."
"“Obstruction of justice is generally committed behind the scenes, so I think both sides are a little overwrought here.”"
"Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor, agreed that Sessions cannot stop the Russia investigation given that he recused himself."
"If Trump wanted to use his power to end the probe, he would have to give the order to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general supervising the Mueller team’s work, and fire Rosenstein if he does not comply, according to Vladeck."
"Trump could also try to replace Sessions as attorney general with someone who does not have a conflict of interest from the campaign, allowing that person to relieve Rosenstein of the responsibility to oversee Mueller, Vladeck said."

"On Wednesday, Bishop Ronald Gainer of the Catholic diocese of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, ordered that the names of all previous Harrisburg bishops from the past seven decades be removed from church buildings and rooms, because they collectively failed to protect children from dozens of predators priests and other Catholic leaders."

"At the same time, Gainer released the names of 71 clergy and seminarians who've been credibly accused of sexual misconduct involving children dating back to 1947, apologized on behalf of the diocese and himself, waived any confidentiality agreements abuse survivors may have signed in legal settlements with the diocese, and released new guidelines for protecting children in the church."
"Grainer said he wanted to release the list of accused predators earlier but was asked to wait until a state grand jury inquiry into abuse in six Pennsylvania Catholic diocese, including Harrisburg, was complete."
"A spokesman for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who ordered the two-year investigation of Catholic sex abuse, said the Harrisburg diocese had pushed to end the grand jury investigation last year."
"The grand jury's findings, including allegations against more than 300 priests accused of sexual abuse dating back to 1947, will likely be released this month after the state Supreme Court gave the green light."

54 Years Ago Today: Government & Media Created & Spread ‘Fake News’ to Start Vietnam War
"However, over the past 54 years, a deluge of information and government officials have come forward showing that most everything the government and the media told Americans about the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie."
The North Vietnamese torpedo boats then attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire.

"Two days later, according to the official story, on August 4, 1962, the NSA reported that a second Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred and US ships were attacked once again."
"The next day, without question, on August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim."
"The outcome of these two incidents was the passage by Congress of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted then-President Lyndon B. Johnson the authority to assist any Southeast Asian country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by “communist aggression.” The resolution served as Johnson’s legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam."
But it wasn’t true.
When the government announced that it had been the victim of an unprovoked attack—this was a lie.
"In the 2003 documentary The Fog of War , the former United States Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara admitted that the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened."
"In 1995, McNamara met with former Vietnam People’s Army General Võ Nguyên Giáp to ask what happened on August 4, 1964 in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident."
"“Absolutely nothing”, Giáp replied."
Giáp claimed that the attack had been imaginary.
"In 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House."
"But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed."
"Tom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam ,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”"
"If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did and over a million lives would’ve been saved."
"Now, retired military officials—who pay attention to history—are even warning about more staged events to pull us into war."
"“I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,” Col. Macgregor said."
“Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.
"We should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotaged by fake news.”"
"Indeed, as TFTP has reported at length, nearly all wars in US history have been started over false information."

"The Death Penalty, Instituted by God Himself (The Biblical Basis for Catholic Teaching on Capital Punishment)"
"Ever since Adam and Eve committed the Original Sin, every living creature is subject to it."
"When Cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother Abel “in the field,” he soon learned that God furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone."
"Cain is told, “What hast thou done?"
.
.
"The Fifth Commandment later delivered to Moses, “Thou shalt not kill,” therefore dates from adamic times, when it operated as God’s exclusive prerogative, allowing no exceptions."
"Only after the Flood, when Noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth, did God delegate to human society His exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause."
"He told Noah, “For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man."
19:21).
"The supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder, but for many other serious offenses: for adultery, rape, sodomy, kidnapping, for striking or cursing parents, for sacrificing a child to Moloch."
24:16).
"Death was also decreed for refusing to accept the decision of the priests in a legal case, and an incorrigible son could be put to death on the testimony of his parents before the proper court."
A priest’s daughter convicted of fornication was burned to death (Lev.
"21:9), but usually the sentence was carried out by stoning, in which the whole community took part as evidence that no private parties were authorized to execute a criminal, but only society as a whole, after due judgment."
"Everyone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to God for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all: “The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people; that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee” (Deut."
17:7).
"The Law read, “Defile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another” (Num."
35:33).
"In order to emphasize the fact that it is God, and not man, who is always the principal party to be avenged, provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found (Deut."
20:1-9).
"This point was brought out by Pope Pius XII in an address to Italian Catholic jurists on May 12, 1954, when he said:"
A penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault: penalty and fault are action and reaction.
Order violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re-establishment of the disturbed equilibrium .
.
.
.
A word must be said on the full meaning of penalty.
"Most of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings, and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law."
"In those theories, the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law, so as to teach the guilty to live honestly, but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed, which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty ."
.
.
.
"In the metaphysical order, penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will, dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being."
"If it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re-establish the violated law, it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice."
"Today the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely, even in cases of proven premeditated murder."
"John Paul II, stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle, has declared that it should be imposed very seldom, if ever."
But doesn’t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice?
"If they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self-defense, to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime, they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic “tradition which comes from the Apostles” actually “develops in the Church” and keeps pace with changing times (II,8)."
The idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing.
"According to one widely held opinion, the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case, and should be discarded as impractical."
"Deterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case, yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty."
"To a man proven to have given false witness against another, Deuteronomy laid down, “They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother."

that others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things.
19:19-21).
8:11).
"The death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians, but is not itself a declared dogma."
Those who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems.
I do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied.
Thus to call for a moratorium .
.
.
is not unjust or incorrect.
"That the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge, and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument."
"Considering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal, he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded, allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him."
"That the penalty is due primarily as expiation to God in justice, and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether."
This first appeared in The Remnant nearly 20 years ago.
Isn't it time to subscribe to the 'paper of record' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution?
The source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the Church is not hard to trace.
"According to statistics published in the National Review for September 16, 1983, out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council, 56 persons were executed."
"In 1965, the year the Council closed, although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850, only 7 were executed."
In the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place.
"At its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century."
Whether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.
"In modern times, which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government, secularism has become the state religion, directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives."
It is only to be expected that materialists—for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has—should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him.
"In the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose."
"Justice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit."
Nor was the idea of “rehabilitation” with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned.
"It has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance, whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins."
"If his contrition is perfect, it’s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven!"
"In any case, neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing."
+++
"As we have seen, the death penalty has a very long history."
"When God set the death penalty in Eden He pronounced it on Himself, to be carried out in the fullness of time through the malicious free wills of his own creatures."
"The Cross which was its instrument is the very sign of Christianity, the only means of salvation."
"Not even from the Cross did Christ decry the death penalty, either for himself or for the two thieves crucified with Him."
28:18) after His Resurrection.
"As He told Pontius Pilate at the time of His trial, “Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above” (John 19:10)."
"Pope Leo XIII re-affirmed this truth in Sapientiae Christianae in 1890, when he declared that “true and legitimate authority is devoid of sanction unless it proceed from God the supreme Ruler and Lord of all."
"The Almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men.” Even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power, it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evil-doers, by death if appropriate."
As St. Paul said:
"Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist purchase to themselves eternal damnation."
"For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil."
.
.
For he is the minister of God to thee for good.
"But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain."
13:2-4).
"A share in making restitution for sin was thus accorded to all of us, for although our Lord’s ignominious death removed from us the guilt of the original transgression through Baptism, it did not remove its effects."
"What Christ did was to sanctify the death penalty, transforming it into a sacrament of life for those who believe."
"As St. Paul declared, “Death is swallowed up in victory."
"O death, where is thy victory?"
"O death, where is thy sting?."
.
.
"For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead."
"And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive” (1 Cor."
15: 54-55; 21-22).
"The first of that numberless host of Christian martyrs who would be put to death by constituted authority for testifying to the truth, Christ commanded His disciples to “Follow me!” Inviting all to Calvary to “suffer under Pontius Pilate” with Him, He granted a meritorious share in accomplishing “the mystery which hath been hidden for ages and generations, but is now made manifest to his saints” to all who, like St. Paul, would “now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things which are wanting of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his body which is the church."
.
".” (Col. 1:26, 24)."
Criminals put to death undergo a penalty no different from the one exacted from the most innocent amongst us.
"This could be a great mercy for them as well as for society, both in terms of expiation and protection from any future crimes they might have perpetrated."
(Apo.
21:4).
Pilger Excoriates Media
"DB: John, what is the latest we know about how Julian Assange is being treated and his current state?"
"John Pilger: His state of health is just about the same, as I understand it."
"He needs medical attention, the kind of treatment you get only in a hospital."
But it has been made clear to him that if he attempts to go to a hospital he will not be given free passage and he will be arrested.
"Since he was arrested in 2010, Assange has not been charged with a single crime."
"My own feeling is that there is a great deal of collusion between the Australian, the British and the US governments–meant to close down WikiLeaks completely and/or deliver Julian Assange to the Americans."
"Recently the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, traveled with senior officials to London and to Washington and raised the whole matter of Julian."
But they raised it in a way that didn’t support the idea that a government should represent its citizens.
These people listened to the more powerful governments.
"In Washington they met Mr. Pompeo, who refused to discuss Assange altogether."
I think there is collusion which amounts to an attempt to try to do a deal with Assange whereby he might be allowed free passage of return to Australia if he shuts down WikiLeaks.
"I think that is very, very likely."
Some very strange things are being said by senior members of these two governments.
There are no serious charges.
He hasn’t been charged with anything.

Was Hunt referring to a deal which has already been done with the United States on extradition?
I don’t know.
All of WikiLeaks’ revelations have been authentic.
"And it has been done “without fear or favor.” Although there has been a concentration on, say, the release of the Hillary Clinton/Podesta emails, or the Iraq and Afghan war logs, WikiLeaks has released information that people have a right to know across the spectrum."
"It has released something like 800,000 documents from Russia, and now WikiLeaks is accused of being an agent of Russia!"
WikiLeaks’ journalism has covered a universal space and that is the first time this has happened.
"In Tunisia, the release of WikiLeaks documents foretold the Arab Spring."
The people at the forefront of the uprising in Tunisia credit WikiLeaks for informing them of what their repressive government was doing behind their backs.
"In Venezuela, WikiLeaks released cables which described in great detail how the United States intended to subvert the government of Hugo Chavez."
"Some of this was published in the mainstream media, when there was still a collaboration with WikiLeaks."
"The Clinton/Podesta emails, which appear to have made a number of people resentful, were published in the New York Times."
That was a very important piece of information for people to know and understand.
"Randy Credico: People sometimes forget that, apart from being a journalist, Julian Assange is a human being."
You have known him a long time.
Could you give us a feel for the kind of person Julian Assange is?
He feels very strongly about the moral basis of WikiLeaks.
"When he first put up WikiLeaks, he wrote that the whole idea of transparency, honoring people’s right to know, was the central aim of the website."
He feels that very strongly.
Any attempt to do a deal with Julian to shut down WikiLeaks will no doubt be resisted.
He is very well read.
He studied physics.
"He has a very good sense of humor, and I have often laughed out loud with him about situations that others might consider too bleak to discuss."
His black humor is a part of his survival kit.
"Obviously, he is incredibly resilient."
"Personally, I could never endure what he has, especially in recent years."
But this comes with a cost and his health is continuing to deteriorate.

"Only seven years ago, the current prime minister said that when an Australian citizen is threatened in this way the prime minister should respond."
That was Turnbull before he became prime minister.
JP: Everything comes down to the relationship with the United States.
That is not entirely the case in Britain.
"Since the loss of its empire after the Second World War, Britain has been eager to play a secondary role to the new imperial power."
"In many parts of the world, Britain is still the biggest corporate investor."
It is interesting to see the corruption that this kind of relationship produces.
The pressure was on from London to keep it going.
Julian is also seen as defying a system and that is just not acceptable.
There is a real element of vindictiveness here.
The Crown Prosecution Service kept this case going when otherwise the European warrant put out by the Swedes would have been abandoned in 2013.
The judge described Julian’s circumstances as if he were on some sort of extended vacation.
"DB: The corporate press has a major responsibility if Julian Assange goes down, don’t you agree?"
"JP: As you know, Dennis, governments do respond to pressure from powerful media interests."
It rarely happens but when it does governments do change their tune.
"There has been no pressure from media in the United States, Britain, Australia or pretty much anywhere except in programs like yours outside the mainstream."
I was looking this morning at a report by Media Lens in Britain describing how the British press has reported on Julian Assange.
The frontal attacks have been coming not from governments but from journalists.
"The WikiLeaks Files: T... WikiLeaks Best Price: $2.75 Buy New $7.00 (as of 12:00 EDT - Details) There used to be spaces within the so-called mainstream for unbiased discussion, for the airing of real grievances and injustices."
These spaces have closed completely.
The attacks on Julian Assange illustrate what has happened to the so-called free media in the West.
WikiLeaks has revealed what journalists should have revealed a long time ago.
"DB: Even the attorney for the New York Times happened to mention that if Julian Assange gets prosecuted, the Times could get prosecuted under the same laws."
The New York Times is part of the establishment.
The difference with WikiLeaks is that it is outside of the establishment and is truly independent.
DB: What would be your strongest plea for Julian Assange?
JP: It’s very simple.
This is about justice.
"In a famous speech given in the 1930’s by Parson Martin Niemoller, he said that first the Nazis came for socialists, but he didn’t speak up because that didn’t concern him."
"Then they came for trade unionists, but he didn’t speak up because that didn’t concern him."
He didn’t speak up when they came for the Jews because he wasn’t a Jew.
"And, of course, finally they came for him."
It means that we have kept quiet.
They say you shouldn’t yell fire in a crowded theater just to get a reaction.

Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal
"Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit):"
"Every time Mass is celebrated, the priest prays that Jesus will “look not on our sins but on the faith of [his] Church… .” That’s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese, well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church."
"I’ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face-to-face with its sins, with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century, has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests."
"While I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there’s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don’t, I don’t think that the Church in the United States will rest — and confidence will be restored — until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn’t happen again."
"The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here."
It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.
"A number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him."
"I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York."
What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.
"When serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press)."
"By the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history."
It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.
"Years before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read — as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer — an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers."
"While the complaint didn’t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation."
"Knowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence."
"I can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him."
"With St. John Paul II’s 1995 visit, he was remembered for “bringing a saint to Newark,” not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests."
"When I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew."
I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.
"While the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there’s still a long way to go in restoring trust, I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you, the faithful of this archdiocese."
"The events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law, regardless of rank or privilege."
"I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct."
"Our heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that “where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church."
"Far from being reassured of this by their bishops, many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an ""inclusive community"" that ""welcomes all"" and ""judges none."""
"All very well and good, except for the fact that the Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance."
"In fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:"
"Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered."""
They are contrary to the natural law.
They close the sexual act to the gift of life.
They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.
Under no circumstances can they be approved.
"(Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)"
Under no circumstances…except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ-friendly or not.
"Even Pope John Paul ""The GREAT's"" Vatican clarified the Church's teaching on October 31, 1986, in the “Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons”:"
"Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder."
"Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option."
It is not.
"Notice the late pope does not say, “Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media."
Does Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn't care about her or the moral code by which she governs?
Does he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics?
"Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our ""Catholic Christian"" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?"
Pope John Paul certainly didn't accept that.
"“It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man.”"
Was Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe?
"Are Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?"
"We're all sinners, of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are, just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh."
"Quite obviously, it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning--and sinning proudly."
This is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about!
"But, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of ""accompaniment"" is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests."
So what's going on here?
"Who are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?"
"Is it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the ""gay lifestyle"" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance?"
"The Catholic Church's new-found ""climate of tolerance"" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!"
Our bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness.
"And neither can God's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our “most enlightened” age---which is, of course, an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting."
Until the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy.
Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal
"Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit):"
"The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here."
"I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York."
What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.
"When serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press)."
It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.
"While the complaint didn’t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation."
"Knowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence."
"When I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew."
I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.
"Our heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that “where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church."
"In fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:"
It is not.
"Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our ""Catholic Christian"" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?"
Pope John Paul certainly didn't accept that.
"Hundreds of Priests Accused in Pennsylvania, Church of Accompaniment in Crisis"
"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday released a sweeping grand jury report on sex abuse in the Catholic Church, listing hundreds of accused clergy and detailing 70 years of misconduct and church response across the state."
"The release is the culmination of an 18-month probe, led by state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, on six of the state’s eight dioceses — Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Scranton, Erie and Greensburg — and follows other state grand jury reports that revealed abuse and coverups in two other dioceses."
Some details and names that might reveal the 300 clergy listed have been redacted from the report.
"Legal challenges by clergy delayed the report’s release, after some said it is a violation of their constitutional rights."
Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled last month that the report must be released but with some redaction.
"Both have further polarized the church on homosexuality, celibacy and whether laypeople should have more power."
It has also triggered debate about whether statutes of limitations should be expanded.
Church officials began bracing for the aftermath of the report.

"Bishop Morlino Targets ‘Homosexual Subculture’ in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus"
"Editor’s Note: Over the years, Bishop Robert Morlino of the Diocese of Madison has confirmed several of my children according to the traditional Rite of Confirmation, as his diocese has been a port in the storm for many displaced and disillusioned Catholic families."
"We don’t see eye-to-eye on everything, of course, but his faith and pastoral solicitude have for us been a light in the darkness and proof that God has not left us orphans."
"And now this, finally, a bishop with the courage to look the beast in the eye and speak its name out loud."
"""If you'll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!"
"As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity."
"As the Book of Proverbs says 'My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov."
8:7).'
It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.
– Bishop Robert Morlino
"In so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes."
"They will be crucified in the media, yes."
Nothing less will do.

Bishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church
"August 18, 2018"
"Dear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison,"
"The past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals."
Still more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light.
"Hearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick."
But my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years.
"For them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities."
"To them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart."
"If you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal."
"Also, if you’ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible."
There is nothing about these stories that is okay.
"Faced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair."
And why?
The reality of sin — even sin in the Church — is nothing new.
"We are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity."
So what is new?
"What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others."
"Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the “wages of sin.”"
For too long we have diminished the reality of sin — we have refused to call a sin a sin — and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy.
"In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life."
In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.
Why do we do this?
Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being “pastoral?” Have we covered over the truth out of fear?
Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?
Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?
"Perhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this."
"In the end, the excuses do not matter."
We must be done with sin.
It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable.
Love sinners?
Yes.
Accept true repentance?
Yes.
But do not say sin is okay.
"And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences."
"For the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come."
The deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church.
"There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living."
"If you’ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!"
"As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity."
"As the Book of Proverbs says “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov."
8:7).” It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.
"There must be no room left, no refuge for sin — either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities."
"To be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled."
In this I speak of all sin.
"We’re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals."
"We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all."
To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.
There has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia.
"That is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia — this despite clear evidence to the contrary."
It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.
"To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable — neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one’s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority."
"In this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick’s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power."
"While recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification."
It is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.
"The Church’s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest."
Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.
"But while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy."
"At the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense."
"In fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come."
"Motivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty."
"The sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians."
The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ’s name.
"It causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds — which is the very definition of scandal."
"And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake."
I said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.
"However, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God."
"No matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God’s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence."
"I have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective."
"Here now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:"
"In the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese."
"This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve."
"We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals."
"Here again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement."
If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim’s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.
"If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don’t want to, please still reach out to us."
"To our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector."
"To our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day."
"You are called to serve Christ’s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours."
This is to keep you very close to God.
"In addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop."
"In obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest — as Christ Himself is calling you to do."
"And by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve."
God will give you the graces to do so.
Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.
"And if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me."
"To the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward."
It will be addressed quickly and justly.
"If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well."
"Again, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church."
"Furthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;"
"I will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;"
I will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.
Failure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;
"I will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;"
"I ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well."
"I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;"
I ask everyone reading this to pray.
"We must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and"
"Finally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy."
"I will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes."
"In addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same."
"Some sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting."
"This letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally."
"More than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil."
We must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness.
We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors — myself included — that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.
We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.
"Again, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and “house cleaning” of this type of depravity."
I stand with them.
I don’t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally.
"But I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”"
"Faithfully yours in the Lord,"
Most Rev.

This text first appeared in the Madison Catholic Herald.
"The backdoor tactics and machinations were brilliantly documented by Edward Pentin , Henry Sire, George Neumayr and an array of investigative journalists."
"The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool."
"– Shakespeare, As You Like It Pope Francis and Cardinal Farrell sit with students at the 2018 pre-synodal meeting for young people."
The upcoming October 2018 Synod of Bishops guarantees more synodal antics as the doctrinal culmination of the “Who Am I to Judge” mantra and the recantation of Church teaching on homosexuality.
Pope Francis announced in the Pre-Synodal meeting that the Church will be listening to all the young people and that “no one will be excluded.” That’s code language that the Pope will be “dialoging” and “accompanying” and “hearing” the pro-LBGT agenda.
"Oh, the providential irony!"
"The two themes of the upcoming Synod of Bishops in Rome are none other than, Youth and Vocations."
Sound familiar?
Do I hear the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report?
"“Some LGBT youths, through various contributions that were received by the General Secretariat of the Synod, wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the Church, while some Bishop Conferences ask themselves what to suggest to young people who decide to create homosexual instead of heterosexual couples and, above all, would like to be close to the Church.” §197 IL"
The emerging homosexual clergy scandal is just beginning to unfold.
"The laity will learn over the course of the next few years that the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests, bishops and cardinals who preyed on the youth, assaulted seminarians, promoted their own ilk, and punished any whistleblowers or noncompliant priests."
Many in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the Church’s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality.
The result?
This is just the very beginning of the dark night of the soul of the Catholic Church.
And the Bishops know it.
"Until it has, this Synod must be cancelled while the civil authorities and law enforcement fully investigate the breadth and depth of the homosexual clerical predation."
The warning signs and rainbow flags are flamboyantly flashing that the 2018 Synod on the Youth and Vocations in Rome presents great moral and physical exploitation of the youth.
"According to the Vatican, the chosen topic of the 2018 Synod, is an “expression of the Church’s pastoral concern for the young,” and is in continuity with the findings of the two-fold synod on the family and Francis’s post-synodal document Amoris Laetitia."
Francis cleverly uses the synodal process to relax church doctrine by employing secular tools of surveys and focus groups.
"And, if the necessary results aren’t computed, they will skewer the results."
Magisterium by majority vote or stuff the ballot box.
"Turn over the documents secret archives involving predation, both in the Vatican and in the chanceries around the globe."
That is the only expression that will demonstrate concern for the young.
"Our petition will remain at the top of our site from now until October, or until the Synod is canceled."
"Please sign and encourage your friends, contacts, and social media associates to do the same."

Pope admits Catholic Church has ‘long ignored’ problem of child abuse
"VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday asked forgiveness for child abuse crimes and cover-ups within the Catholic Church, admitting that the pain of victims “was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced.”"
"“Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others,” he added."
"Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,” he added."

This is exactly the Scriptural point that I want to make.
From the pulpits in America today we here the events unfold of Sodom and Gomorra and how Abraham should have prayed longer in hopes that God would have spared them rather than the righteous people in Sodom and Gomorra doing what God had commanded.
"And of course, not a second thought on man's behalf is given concerning the victims in these two cities."
Here is Abraham’s account…
"“And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
"And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him."
"And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know."
"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord."
"And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it."
"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there."
"And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake."
"And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there."
"And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there."
"And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake."
"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there."
"And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake."
"And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place."""
-Genesis 18:16-33
Got questions.org explains very well…
"Genesis chapter 19 records the two angels, disguised as human men, visiting Sodom and Gomorrah."
Lot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house.
The angels agreed.
"The Bible then informs us, ""Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom — both young and old — surrounded the house."
"They called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight?"
Genesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver.
"Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities..."" (Genesis 19:2 4) ."
"In light of the passage, the most common response to the question, ""What was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah?"""
is that it was homosexuality.
"That is how the term ”sodomy” came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced."
"Clearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities."
"At the same time, it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah."
The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.
"So, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities."
Those who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality.
The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable.
But to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.
"To this day, the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland."
(Jeremiah 22:3) God must be true and judgment must commence.
"Men today, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, are not valiant for the truth."
They are valiant to proceed from evil to evil (Jeremiah 5).
"They care more about the pleasures of sin for a season, than they are grieved for the afflictions of Joseph (Amos 6:6; Hebrews 11:25)."
Men today care more of compromise (where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong) and diplomacy (seduction in another guise) in promoting anarchy through “antinomianism” than they do the Law of God against the sins unto judgment that enslave men (John 8:34).
"Instead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good (Amos 5:15) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10), they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation."
They wear the cross.
"Yet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required: “Deny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me” (Matthew 16:24; Romans 1:16; 2 Corinthians 5:15, 13:4-5; Galatians 2:21)."
"Then again, these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out ""Crucify him!"
Crucify him!
"We have no king but Caesar"" (John 19:15)."
And these are the same people today persecuting living Christians while praising the dead ones (Matthew 5:10).
"They continuously preach of the heroism of Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, Gideon, Samson and others from the pulpit and fail to understand what these men were doing when serving their generations (Psalm 71:18-19; Isaiah 51:4)."
"Today, instead of doing the same, they simply hide under a false grace (Isaiah 30) and give themselves over to a man, the president, and declare end times."
They declare we're in the end times because they have failed to stand up and fight for their posterity in keeping the Lord's commandments and His judgments (Psalm 78:1-11).
Why did God judge Sodom and Gomorrah?

Cardinal Theodore McCarrick: Yet Another Fruit of Vatican II
"Still, we’re also averse to speaking in terms of good and evil."
Right and wrong?
Maybe.
"The evils we encounter in our day-to-day lives might not be a spectacle, like jihadists beheading a journalist on live television."
"All the same, evil is part of ordinary life."
It dwells deep in our hearts – each and every one of us.
"Our saving grace is that, while Westerners no longer believe in God, they still believe in the Devil."
"We’re at least clear-eyed enough to recognize true evil at work in the world, even if we can no longer see the great Good hidden behind the veil."
This is the point about the McCarrick scandal that even religious commentators tend to overlook.
How was he allowed to go on molesting young priests and seminarians when virtually the entire Church hierarchy knew what he was up to?
What could suit the Devil more than to watch the Church burn her wheat as she gathers the chaff?
"The gates of Hell will not prevail against the Church, as Our Lord promised."
"But they won’t stop trying, either."
"They’ve attacked from the front, sending the Roman pagans, French Revolutionaries, and British American secularists."
"They flank us by sending heretics like Arius, Luther, and Hans Kung."
Where did those fifth columnists enter?
Aggiornamento sounds like a Lefebvrist slur.
The idea that an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church would openly seek to “bring itself up to date” is ridiculous.
Yet that was precisely the aim.
"As St Pope John XXIII explained, “Its principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the Church after 20 centuries of life.” It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570."
"The goal was to align the Church more with modern world: a world defined, to a considerable extent, by its rejection of the Catholic world that flourished before the Protestant Reformation and French Revolution."
"Now, I don’t believe Pope John saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred, immutable tradition."
I share Pope Paul IV’s view.
"Nonetheless, he stirred it."
The spirit of aggiornamento quickly spread through the Church in the 1960s – and the seminaries especially.
Seminarians called for a more “participatory” administration.
They became involved in socialist politics.
They formed trade unions to demand the right to marry.
They practiced sauvage intercommunion.
"Of course, they had their enablers in the hierarchy as well."
"Perhaps the worst was Archbishop Marty of Paris, a leader of the “priest-worker movement” who defended Marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the Council."
"During a homily at the Cathedral, he also praised the soixantehuitards: “the great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its place in life” that occurred in his city in May of 1968."
"“One also felt that, in these events of May,” Marty continued, “the seriousness of the working class, which wants not only to earn a living wage, but also to find its freedom, its independence.” Theaggiornamentistas was never purged from the Church, and certainly not from the seminaries."
"As the modern world continued to reject traditional Christian mores, so too does the Church seem increasingly “out of step” and in need of “modernizing”."
"Inevitably, this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality."
"Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, infamously spoke of “an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.”"
But that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se.
"Rather, the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more (shall we say) opportunities for gay men – given that there are, of course, no women in Catholic seminaries."
"This began driving away heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church’s teachings on chastity and celibacy."
But the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to “seduce” his victims.
"Many have also speculated that, because McCarrick’s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent, the media didn’t consider them newsworthy."
"If he’d fondled a 12-year old altar boy, that would have been one thing."
But taking an 18-year-old seminarian to bed?
"Meanwhile, those bishops who didn’t approve of his actions knew the culture – both within the Church and without her – were against them."
The post-Vatican Church doesn’t like to come off as a nag.
She’s not going to cause a fuss by purging sexually active gay men from the clergy just because… what?
It’s immoral?
That’s not very aggiornamentistic!
"The world and our worldly bishops were, unsurprisingly, of one mind."
"And even if they were disgusted by McCarrick, these prelates weren’t willing to jeopardize their careers by standing for justice against vice."
We seem to be slouching back to the old traditionalist trope: All the Church’s problems would be solved if we’d just go back to the Latin Mass.
And we can’t drag the Church out of her present crisis until we have the courage to brave accusations of “Lefebvrism” and say so.
It isn’t.
Its obsession with “modernization” leads it to only adopt the vices of modernity.
"Instead of serving as ambassadors from the City of God, far too many of our priests and prelates have become agents of the City of Man."
I don’t know what it will take to set things right.
Christ promised.
"Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States Accuses Pope of McCarrick Cover-up, Calls on Francis to Resign"
"I am thinking in particular of the United States of America, where I was sent as Apostolic Nuncio by Pope Benedict XVI on October 19, 2011, the memorial feast of the First North American Martyrs."
"The Bishops of the United States are called, and I with them, to follow the example of these first martyrs who brought the Gospel to the lands of America, to be credible witnesses of the immeasurable love of Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life."
May God save His Church MJM
"So serious is the cover-up that for the good of the Church and protection of the faithful, Archbishop Vigano has called on Pope Francis to resign."
"But before Francis resigns, we the Catholic faithful demand that he also remove from the College of Cardinals those who conspired even before the 2013 conclave to make Jorge Mario Bergoglio pope come hell or high water."
He and the St. Gallen Group know exactly who they are.
"Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò's 11-page statement, released to the National Catholic Register, accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick, ignoring the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on McCarrick, and also of making McCarrick a trusted counselor who became Francis's ""kingmaker"" when it came to American appointments and was highly instrumental in the Pope's decision to elevate far-Left bishops such as Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark to the College of Cardinals."
The former apostolic nuncio to the United States has accused Francis of repealing sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI on then-Cardinal McCarrick for sexual abuse.
“Whatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops” (Lk.
12:3).
"I had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the Church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth, to amend and to renew itself."
"That is why, even though I had repeatedly been asked to do so, I always avoided making statements to the media, even when it would have been my right to do so, in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me, even by high-ranking prelates of the Roman Curia."
"But now that the corruption has reached the very top of the Church’s hierarchy, my conscience dictates that I reveal those truths regarding the heart-breaking case of the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C., Theodore McCarrick, which I came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by St. John Paul II, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, from 1998 to 2009, and by Pope Benedict XVI, as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, from October 19, 2011 until end of May 2016."
"As Delegate for Pontifical Representations in the Secretariat of State, my responsibilities were not limited to the Apostolic Nunciatures, but also included the staff of the Roman Curia (hires, promotions, informational processes on candidates to the episcopate, etc.)"
"and the examination of delicate cases, including those regarding cardinals and bishops, that were entrusted to the Delegate by the Cardinal Secretary of State or by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State."
"Indeed, according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote, Father Boniface Ramsey, O.P.’s letter, dated November 22, 2000, was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo."
"In the letter, Father Ramsey, who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the ’80s until 1996, affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop “shared his bed with seminarians,” inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house."
"And he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians, some of whom were later ordained priests for the Archdiocese of Newark, who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the Archbishop."
"The office that I held at the time was not informed of any measure taken by the Holy See after those charges were brought by Nuncio Montalvo at the end of 2000, when Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State."
"The Nuncio added that Littleton had already forwarded his Memorandum to about twenty people, including civil and ecclesiastical judicial authorities, police and lawyers, in June 2006, and that it was therefore very likely that the news would soon be made public."
He therefore called for a prompt intervention by the Holy See.
"In my memo, which I delivered on that same December 6, 2006 to my direct superior, the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, I proposed the following considerations and course of action to my superiors:"
"- Given that it seemed a new scandal of particular gravity, as it regarded a cardinal, was going to be added to the many scandals for the Church in the United States,"
"- and that, since this matter had to do with a cardinal, and according to can."
"1405 § 1, No."
"2˚, “ipsius Romani Pontificis dumtaxat ius est iudicandi”;"
"- I proposed that an exemplary measure be taken against the Cardinal that could have a medicinal function, to prevent future abuses against innocent victims and alleviate the very serious scandal for the faithful, who despite everything continued to love and believe in the Church."
"I added that it would be salutary if, for once, ecclesiastical authority would intervene before the civil authorities and, if possible, before the scandal had broken out in the press."
This could have restored some dignity to a Church so sorely tried and humiliated by so many abominable acts on the part of some pastors.
"My memo of December 6, 2006 was kept by my superiors, and was never returned to me with any actual decision by the superiors on this matter."
"Subsequently, around April 21-23, 2008, the Statement for Pope Benedict XVI about the pattern of sexual abuse crisis in the United States, by Richard Sipe, was published on the internet, at richardsipe.com."
"On April 24, it was passed on by the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal William Levada, to the Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone."
"It was delivered to me one month later, on May 24, 2008."
"The following day, I delivered a new memo to the new Substitute, Fernando Filoni, which included my previous one of December 6, 2006."
"In it, I summarized Richard Sipe’s document, which ended with this respectful and heartfelt appeal to Pope Benedict XVI: “I approach Your Holiness with due reverence, but with the same intensity that motivated Peter Damian to lay out before your predecessor, Pope Leo IX, a description of the condition of the clergy during his time."
The problems he spoke of are similar and as great now in the United States as they were then in Rome.
"If Your Holiness requests, I will personally submit to you documentation of that about which I have spoken.”"
"I ended my memo by repeating to my superiors that I thought it was necessary to intervene as soon as possible by removing the cardinal’s hat from Cardinal McCarrick and that he should be subjected to the sanctions established by the Code of Canon Law, which also provide for reduction to the lay state."
"Pope Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis: the Cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance."
"I certainly do not believe it was Pope Benedict, who as Cardinal had repeatedly denounced the corruption present in the Church, and in the first months of his pontificate had already taken a firm stand against the admission into seminary of young men with deep homosexual tendencies."
"I believe it was due to the Pope’s first collaborator at the time, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who notoriously favored promoting homosexuals into positions of responsibility, and was accustomed to managing the information he thought appropriate to convey to the Pope."
"In any case, what is certain is that Pope Benedict imposed the above canonical sanctions on McCarrick and that they were communicated to him by the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi."
"Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, then first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington and Chargé d'Affaires a.i."
"after the unexpected death of Nuncio Sambi in Baltimore, told me when I arrived in Washington — and he is ready to testify to it— about a stormy conversation, lasting over an hour, that Nuncio Sambi had with Cardinal McCarrick whom he had summoned to the Nunciature."
Monsignor Lantheaume told me that “the Nuncio’s voice could be heard all the way out in the corridor.”
"Pope Benedict’s same dispositions were then also communicated to me by the new Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, in November 2011, in a conversation before my departure for Washington, and were included among the instructions of the same Congregation to the new Nuncio."
"In turn, I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature."
"The Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance."
"It is therefore my duty to reveal what I know about this, beginning with the Roman Curia."
Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information was communicated to him.
"In November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick."
It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.
"He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up."
"Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed."
"Benedict reacted, despite Sodano’s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned."
"Was McCarrick’s appointment to Washington and as Cardinal the work of Sodano, when John Paul II was already very ill?"
We are not given to know.
"However, it is legitimate to think so, but I do not think he was the only one responsible for this."
"McCarrick frequently went to Rome and made friends everywhere, at all levels of the Curia."
"If Sodano had protected Maciel, as seems certain, there is no reason why he wouldn’t have done so for McCarrick, who according to many had the financial means to influence decisions."
"His nomination to Washington was opposed by then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re."
"At the Nunciature in Washington there is a note, written in his hand, in which Cardinal Re disassociates himself from the appointment and states that McCarrick was 14th on the list for Washington."
"Nuncio Sambi’s report, with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State."
"My two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute."
"As already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict."
"Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the current Secretary of State, was also complicit in covering up the misdeeds of McCarrick who had, after the election of Pope Francis, boasted openly of his travels and missions to various continents."
"In April 2014, the Washington Times had a front page report on McCarrick’s trip to the Central African Republic, and on behalf of the State Department no less."
"As Nuncio to Washington, I wrote to Cardinal Parolin asking him if the sanctions imposed on McCarrick by Pope Benedict were still valid."
Ça va sans dire that my letter never received any reply!
"The same can be said for Cardinal William Levada, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for Cardinals Marc Ouellet, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Lorenzo Baldisseri, former Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops, and Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari, current Secretary of the same Congregation."
They were all aware by reason of their office of the sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict on McCarrick.
"Cardinals Leonardo Sandri, Fernando Filoni and Angelo Becciu, as Substitutes of the Secretariat of State, knew in every detail the situation regarding Cardinal McCarrick."
Nor could Cardinals Giovanni Lajolo and Dominique Mamberti have failed to know.
"As Secretaries for Relations with States, they participated several times a week in collegial meetings with the Secretary of State."
"As far as the Roman Curia is concerned, for the moment I will stop here, even if the names of other prelates in the Vatican are well known, even some very close to Pope Francis, such as Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio and Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality, a current already denounced in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then-Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in the Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons."
"Cardinals Edwin Frederick O’Brien and Renato Raffaele Martino also belong to the same current, albeit with a different ideology."
Others belonging to this current even reside at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.
Now to the United States.
"Obviously, the first to have been informed of the measures taken by Pope Benedict was McCarrick’s successor in Washington See, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as Bishop of Pittsburgh."
"It is absolutely unthinkable that Nunzio Sambi, who was an extremely responsible person, loyal, direct and explicit in his way of being (a true son of Romagna) did not speak to him about it."
"In any case, I myself brought up the subject with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it."
"I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick."
"I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it."
"If, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?"
Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.
"Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters."
"Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written."
The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.
"However, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did."
I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.
But the Cardinal knew nothing about it!
"Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C."
"In doing so, he put other seminarians at risk."
"Bishop Paul Bootkoski, emeritus of Metuchen, and Archbishop John Myers, emeritus of Newark, covered up the abuses committed by McCarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims."
They cannot deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter.
"Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who was recently interviewed by the media, also said that he didn’t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by McCarrick."
"Given his tenure in Washington, Dallas and now Rome, I think no one can honestly believe him."
I don’t know if he was ever asked if he knew about Maciel’s crimes.
"If he were to deny this, would anybody believe him given that he occupied positions of responsibility as a member of the Legionaries of Christ?"

"In the last months of his pontificate, Pope Benedict XVI had convened a meeting of all the apostolic nuncios in Rome, as Paul VI and St. John Paul II had done on several occasions."
"The date set for the audience with the Pope was Friday, June 21, 2013."
Pope Francis kept this commitment made by his predecessor.
Of course I also came to Rome from Washington.
"It was my first meeting with the new Pope elected only three months prior, after the resignation of Pope Benedict."
"On the morning of Thursday, June 20, 2013, I went to the Domus Sanctae Marthae, to join my colleagues who were staying there."
"As soon as I entered the hall I met Cardinal McCarrick, who wore the red-trimmed cassock."
I greeted him respectfully as I had always done.
"He immediately said to me, in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant: “The Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China.”"
"At the time I knew nothing of his long friendship with Cardinal Bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election, as McCarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at Villanova University and in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter."
"Nor had I ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave, and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave."
"Therefore I did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that McCarrick had communicated to me, but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following."
The next day the audience with Pope Francis took place.
"After his address, which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff, the Pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one."
"In single file, I remember that I was among the last."
"When it was my turn, I just had time to say to him, “I am the Nuncio to the United States.” He immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach, using these words: “The Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized!"
"I had in my hand a book in Portuguese that Cardinal O’Malley had sent me for the Pope a few days earlier, telling me “so he could go over his Portuguese before going to Rio for World Youth Day.” I handed it to him immediately, and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation."
At the end of the audience the Pope announced: “Those of you who are still in Rome next Sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.” I naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the Pope intended to tell me.
"On Sunday June 23, before the concelebration with the Pope, I asked Monsignor Ricca, who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments, if he could ask the Pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week."
How could I have returned to Washington without having clarified what the Pope wanted of me?
"At the end of Mass, while the Pope was greeting the few lay people present, Monsignor Fabian Pedacchio, his Argentine secretary, came to me and said: “The Pope told me to ask if you are free now!” Naturally, I replied that I was at the Pope’s disposal and that I thanked him for receiving me immediately."
The Pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said: “We have 40 minutes before the Angelus.”
"I began the conversation, asking the Pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when I greeted him the previous Friday."
"And the Pope, in a very different, friendly, almost affectionate tone, said to me: “Yes, the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing like the Archbishop of Philadelphia, (the Pope did not give me the name of the Archbishop) they must be shepherds; and they must not be left-wing — and he added, raising both arms — and when I say left-wing I mean homosexual.” Of course, the logic of the correlation between being left-wing and being homosexual escaped me, but I added nothing else."
"Immediately after, the Pope asked me in a deceitful way: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him."
"But then, what was the Pope’s purpose in asking me that question: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not."
"Back in Washington everything became very clear to me, thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with Pope Francis."
"When the new Bishop Mark Seitz took possession of the Diocese of El Paso on July 9, 2013, I sent the first Counsellor, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, while I went to Dallas that same day for an international meeting on Bioethics."
"When he got back, Monsignor Lantheaume told me that in El Paso he had met Cardinal McCarrick who, taking him aside, told him almost the same words that the Pope had said to me in Rome: “the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing, they must be shepherds….” I was astounded!"
"It was therefore clear that the words of reproach that Pope Francis had addressed to me on June 21, 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by Cardinal McCarrick."
"Also the Pope’s mention “not like the Archbishop of Philadelphia” could be traced to McCarrick, because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to Communion of pro-abortion politicians."
"In his communication to the bishops, McCarrick had manipulated a letter of then-Cardinal Ratzinger who prohibited giving them Communion."
"Indeed, I also knew how certain Cardinals such as Mahony, Levada and Wuerl, were closely linked to McCarrick; they had opposed the most recent appointments made by Pope Benedict, for important posts such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Denver and San Francisco."
"Not happy with the trap he had set for me on June 23, 2013, when he asked me about McCarrick, only a few months later, in the audience he granted me on October 10, 2013, Pope Francis set a second one for me, this time concerning a second of his protégés, Cardinal Donald Wuerl."
Once again the Pope did not show any reaction.
"It was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews."
"In a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, he had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration."
"This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal."
With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops.
"In addition, he appointed the Brazilian Ilson de Jesus Montanari — the great friend of his private Argentine secretary Fabian Pedacchio — as Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops and Secretary of the College of Cardinals, promoting him in one single leap from a simple official of that department to Archbishop Secretary."
Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.
"During the speech he gave when he took possession of the Chicago See, at which I was present as a representative of the Pope, Cupich quipped that one certainly should not expect the new Archbishop to walk on water."
"Perhaps it would be enough for him to be able to remain with his feet on the ground and not try to turn reality upside-down, blinded by his pro-gay ideology, as he stated in a recent interview with America Magazine."
"Extolling his particular expertise in the matter, having been President of the Committee on Protection of Children and Young People of the USCCB, he asserted that the main problem in the crisis of sexual abuse by clergy is not homosexuality, and that affirming this is only a way of diverting attention from the real problem which is clericalism."
"In support of this thesis, Cupich “oddly” made reference to the results of research carried out at the height of the sexual abuse of minors crisis in the early 2000s, while he “candidly” ignored that the results of that investigation were totally denied by the subsequent Independent Reports by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2004 and 2011, which concluded that, in cases of sexual abuse, 81% of the victims were male."
"In fact, Father Hans Zollner, S.J., Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, President of the Centre for Child Protection, and Member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, recently told the newspaper La Stampa that “in most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse.”"
"The appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: “Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.” McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick’s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016."
"These characters are closely associated with individuals belonging in particular to the deviated wing of the Society of Jesus, unfortunately today a majority, which had already been a cause of serious concern to Paul VI and subsequent pontiffs."
"We need only consider Father Robert Drinan, S.J., who was elected four times to the House of Representatives, and was a staunch supporter of abortion; or Father Vincent O’Keefe, S.J., one of the principal promoters of The Land O’Lakes Statement of 1967, which seriously compromised the Catholic identity of universities and colleges in the United States."
"It should be noted that McCarrick, then President of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, also participated in that inauspicious undertaking which was so harmful to the formation of the consciences of American youth, closely associated as it was with the deviated wing of the Jesuits."
"Father James Martin, S.J., acclaimed by the people mentioned above, in particular Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy, appointed Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications, well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families, is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the Society of Jesus."
Pope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church and for bishops and faithful to act with parrhesia.
The faithful throughout the world also demand this of him in an exemplary manner.
"He must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by McCarrick, who abused his authority with seminarians and priests."
"In any case, the Pope learned about it from me on June 23, 2013 and continued to cover for him."
He did not take into account the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on him and made him his trusted counselor along with Maradiaga.
"The latter [Maradiaga] is so confident of the Pope’s protection that he can dismiss as “gossip” the heartfelt appeals of dozens of his seminarians, who found the courage to write to him after one of them tried to commit suicide over homosexual abuse in the seminary."
"In the case of the former Auxiliary Bishop Juan José Pineda, after the article published in the [Italian] weekly L’Espresso last February, Maradiaga stated in the newspaper Avvenire: “It was my auxiliary bishop Pineda who asked for the visitation, so as to ‘clear’ his name after being subjected to much slander.” Now, regarding Pineda the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere."
"In the name of the transparency so hailed by the Pope, the report that the Visitator, Argentine bishop Alcides Casaretto, delivered more than a year ago only and directly to the Pope, must be made public."
"Finally, the recent appointment as Substitute of Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra is also connected with Honduras, that is, with Maradiaga."
From 2003 to 2007 Peña Parra worked as Counsellor at the Tegucigalpa Nunciature.
As Delegate for Pontifical Representations I received worrisome information about him.
"In Honduras, a scandal as huge as the one in Chile is about to be repeated."
"The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops."
First he insulted the abuse victims.
"Even in the tragic affair of McCarrick, Pope Francis’s behavior was no different."
"Although he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick’s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church."
"It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action [regarding McCarrick] to save his image in the media."
"Now in the United States a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful, and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests, asking that all those who, by their silence, covered up McCarrick’s criminal behavior, or who used him to advance their career or promote their intentions, ambitions and power in the Church, should resign."
A time of conversion and penance must be proclaimed.
The virtue of chastity must be recovered in the clergy and in seminaries.
Corruption in the misuse of the Church’s resources and of the offerings of the faithful must be fought against.
The seriousness of homosexual behavior must be denounced.
"The homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated, as Janet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote."
"“The problem of clergy abuse,” she wrote, “cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives."
"The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.” These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church."
"I implore everyone, especially Bishops, to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread, and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities."
"In his 2008 homily on the Feast of the Epiphany, Pope Benedict reminded us that the Father’s plan of salvation had been fully revealed and realized in the mystery of Christ’s death and resurrection, but it needs to be welcomed in human history, which is always a history of fidelity on God’s part and unfortunately also of infidelity on the part of us men."
"At the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: “Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ..."
"If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it."
"We need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.” If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church’s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt."
And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!
Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.
"Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ’s flock."
"In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them."
"Even in dismay and sadness over the enormity of what is happening, let us not lose hope!"
We well know that the great majority of our pastors live their priestly vocation with fidelity and dedication.
It is in moments of great trial that the Lord’s grace is revealed in abundance and makes His limitless mercy available to all; but it is granted only to those who are truly repentant and sincerely propose to amend their lives.
"This is a favorable time for the Church to confess her sins, to convert, and to do penance."
"Let us all pray for the Church and for the Pope, let us remember how many times he has asked us to pray for him!"
"Let us all renew faith in the Church our Mother: “I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church!”"
Christ will never abandon His Church!
He generated her in His Blood and continually revives her with His Spirit!

"If Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy “the filthy Jewish entity” and conquer America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy, he would be accused of “Islamophobia” and “bigotry.” But no one will take any particular notice of this."
"They should, however."
Khecharem is not some deluded fanatic raving on a Tunisian street corner.
"He was speaking at Hizb ut-Tahrir’s International Caliphate Conference; although Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in many countries, it still has an international presence, and recently held a conference in Chicago."
Nor is the desire to establish a global caliphate limited to Hizb ut-Tahrir alone.
"The word khalifa means “successor”; the caliph in Sunni Islamic theology is the successor of Muhammad as the military, political, and spiritual leader of the Muslims."
"As I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history, from the immediate post-Muhammad period of the “Rightly Guided Caliphs” to the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, as well as other Islamic states, all waged relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims, subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights."
"This was, for fourteen centuries, mainstream, normative Islam, carried forth by the primary authorities in the Islamic world at the time."
"The History of Jihad shows from the accounts of eyewitnesses and contemporary chroniclers through the ages that in every age and in every place where there were Muslims, some of them believed that they had a responsibility given to them by Allah to wage war against and subjugate unbelievers under the rule of Islamic law."
"And so it is today: Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days, but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists."
What is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain.
"As the jihadis move against non-Muslim states without any letup, pause, period of coexistence, period of tolerance, reformation, or reconsideration, there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them."
"While it is undoubtedly true that not all Muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad, there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it."
So it is today.
"Islamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations after every jihad terror attack, but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one."
"Meanwhile, Said Khecharem and other Islamic spokesmen openly call for Muslims to engage in jihad conquest."
"Western authorities should be pondering his words, and their implications, very carefully."
Article posted with permission from Robert Spencer
"In his eleven-page account, affirmed under oath, the Archbishop, marking a turning point in Church history, declares that senior Vatican officials, including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga, coordinator of Pope Bergoglio’s “Council of Cardinals”, covered up McCarrick’s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup."
"Regarding Bergoglio, Viganò testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about McCarrick’s history, the dossier of the Congregation for Bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men, and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by Benedict XVI (forbidding residence in a seminary, public appearances and Masses)."
"Evidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a “trusted counselor” who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit."
"Viganò concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church."
"As to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public:"
[my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.
[emphasis in original]
"Before he was papal nuncio in Washington, Viganò headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia."
In those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony.
The campaign to discredit Archbishop Viganò began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing.
"John Allen’s instant analysis attempting to impeach Viganò’s testimony is, as one would expect from him, a bit craftier."
Evidence.
"Furthermore, a series of prelates has vouched for Viganò’s character and credibility:"
"- Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas has gone so far as to order all the priests in his diocese to read from the pulpit a statement that he finds Viganò’s allegations credible."
Bergoglio Pleads the Fifth
"Bergoglio himself, however, has already precluded any attempt to impeach Viganò’s testimony."
"During the return flight from Dublin after the “World Meeting of Familes,” he was asked to comment on Viganò ’s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick’s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict."
Bergoglio declined to incriminate himself:
Read the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment.
I am not going to say a word about this.
"I believe that the statement speaks for itself, and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions."
It is an act of trust.
"When a little time goes by, and you have drawn conclusions, perhaps I will speak about it, but I would like your professional maturity to do this work."
"It will do you all good, really."
Seems to be.
Obviously.
"While events have overtaken Faggioli’s piece, it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo-Catholic polemic."
"But before I address Faggioli’s latest defense of the indefensible, some background is in order, including a discussion of further key details of Viganò’s testimony."
This would explain why he will not a “say a word about” Viganò’s charges against him.
"The Archbishop reveals, as already noted, that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he “was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.” Viganò further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi, but were also repeated by Viganò himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio:"
I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.
Viganò wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions.
During the audience Bergoglio queried: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” and Viganò replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear:
"I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him."
"It was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews…."
"It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action to save his image in the media."
[all emphasis in original]
"It was McCarrick, noted Marco Tosatti, who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago, where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin."
"Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.” That is, the normal process was circumvented for these appointments."
"As I wrote back then, with the likes of Cupich in view:"
Cupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop.
"And it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal’s hat for his roommate of six years, Kevin Farrell, whom he consecrated a bishop."
But Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin’s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church.
"A Worldwide Network of Corruption, Beginning at the Top"
None of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests.
"Moreover, it was Bergoglio’s right hand man, Cardinal Maradiaga, who sheltered his friend, Juan José Pineda, auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa, from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese."
"This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal."
"The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops."
"First, he insulted the abuse victims."
"Then, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati."
[emphasis added]
Defending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo
I stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano.
"Today, our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news."
"Wuerl, says Faggioli, “faces a complex situation: on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry… while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases… It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol… beyond the specific accusations against him, from which he could not publicly defend himself.”"
….
"I myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it."
"I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick."
"I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it."
Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.
"Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters."
"Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written."
The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.
I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.
But the Cardinal knew nothing about it!
"Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C."
[emphasis in original]
"What really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his “complex situation,” which is not complex at all."
But what exactly is a neo-traditionalist?
"But one must realize that this council, which exposed itself to human judgment, insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man, rather than on his unpleasant one."
Its attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic.
"Instead of depressing diagnoses, encouraging remedies; instead of direful prognostics, messages of trust issued from the council to the present-day world."
[emphasis added]
Faggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of “Catholic Jacobins” for “hate speech” than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes.
A return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young.
"For some, it seems, no price is too great—not even the good of the Church—to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history."
Conclusion: The Fatima Connection
"Long before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome, the successive Vatican Secretaries of State, Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone, were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment."
"As to Bertone and Sodano, Viganò provides further vital testimony:"
"Nuncio Sambi’s report [on McCarrick’s sexual abuse], with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State."
"My two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute."
Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information [concerning McCarrick] was communicated to him.
"In November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick."
It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.
"He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up."
"Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed."
"Concerning my book, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Viganò’s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington, whom Viganò’ credits with diligently reporting McCarrick’s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict’s sanctions to McCarrick, made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan, published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican:"
"We were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima, the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia, and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed."
"Sambi said, “Excuse me.” He got up, went out of the room, and came back with a book."
"“Here,” he said."
“Do you know this book?
You should read it.” It was Christopher Ferrara's The Secret Still Hidden.
"“Wait,” I said."
"And in the end, we are all after the truth, aren’t we?"
The truth is the important thing...”
The truth is indeed the important thing.
"And the truth about our situation is revealed in that still-hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010, identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000, which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places:"
[emphasis added]
I can only conclude by making my own these closing words of Archbishop Viganò:
9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad
"[Pre-Order Jamie Glazov's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us, HERE.]"
"Frontpage is most confident that the suggested steps below will continue to be the overall focus of the new administration -- which, thankfully, is now taking many of the crucial and constructive steps vis-à-vis our enemy."
We find the article more relevant and urgent than ever due to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 approaching tomorrow:

9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.
By Jamie Glazov
Label the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment.
3.
Stop “Partnering” With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups.
"The government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately."
4.
5.
Launch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.
The Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24/7.
"Consequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions."
"This has to also involve, as Gorka urges, “a nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.”"
6.
Affirm Sharia’s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious.
remember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI).
"Indeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious."
7.
"Put Pressure on Mosques, Islamic Groups and Schools."
(This will be a part of Gorka’s suggested counter-propaganda campaign discussed in Step #5).
8.
Bring Counter-Jihadists into the Government.
Instead of having Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers like Mohamed Elibiary serving on the U.S.
(P.S.
But the debate over this belongs in another forum.
"And whatever the answer, it does not mean that the effort to empower Muslims who want to make the anti-jihadist Islamic vision possible should not be made.)"
9.
"Bill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit."
"Jamie Glazov holds a Ph.D. in History with a specialty in Russian, U.S. and Canadian foreign policy."
"He is the editor of Frontpagemag.com, the author of the critically-acclaimed, United in Hate: The Left’s Romance with Tyranny and Terror, and the host of the web-tv show, The Glazov Gang."
"His new book is Jihadist Psychopath: How He is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us."
"Visit his site at JamieGlazov.com, follow him on Twitter: @JamieGlazov, and reach him at [email protected]"
And Google likely violated federal election laws — not to mention the privacy of its users — in the services it provided the Clinton campaign.
"The email was sent by Eliana Murillo, the former head of Google’s multicultural marketing department."
"The email was forwarded to Google vice presidents and other staff members throughout the company, Carlson said."
According to Carlson:
We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.
The assistance Google provided to the Clinton campaign likely violated election laws and served as an unreported in-kind contribution.
"Of course, anyone who paid attention was aware of Google’s attempts to interfere on Clinton’s behalf."
WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange revealed two years ago that Google CEO Eric Schmidt and a number of Google employees created a company in 2015 specifically to place Clinton the White House.
"Emails obtained by WikiLeaks showed correspondence between Schmidt and Clinton, along with a number of Clinton operatives discussing strategy meetings and campaign ideas."
Among the strategies was the creation of a voter tracking database using smart phones.
A report by a research team earlier this year found that Google can manipulate opinions of undecided voters by inserting negative search suggestions under the name of a candidate.

Google Was ‘Working To Get Hillary Clinton Elected’
"The email was sent by the former head of Google’s multicultural marketing department, Eliana Mario, on November 9, 2016."
"… It was, in effect, an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton for President campaign."
"… In the end, Google was disappointed."
"As Mario herself conceded “ultimately after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us."
We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.

"This, of course, isn’t the first evidence of Google doing all they could to help Hillary win the election."
"In an April 15, 2014 email from Google’s then-Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt found in the WikiLeaked Podesta emails, titled “Notes for a 2016 Democratic Campaign,” Schmidt tells Cheryl Mills that “I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better."
This is simply a draft but do let me know if this is a helpful process for you all.”
Key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them.
"In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify, meet, and update profiles on the voter."
"A dynamic volunteer can easily speak with a voter and, with their email or other digital handle, get the voter videos and other answers to areas they care about (“the benefits of ACA to you” etc.)"
"As a reminder, in late October of 2016 it was revealed that just days prior to the April 15, 2014 email, Schmidt had sent another email in which he expressed his eagerness to “fund” the campaign efforts and wants to be a “head outside advisor.” In the email from John Podesta to Robby Mook we learned that:"
I met with Eric Schmidt tonight.
"As David reported, he’s ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc."
He was more deferential on structure than I expected.
Wasn’t pushing to run through one of his existing firms.
"Clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn’t seem like he wanted to push others out."
Clearly wants to get going.
He’s still in DC tomorrow and would like to meet with you if you are in DC in the afternoon.
I think it’s worth doing.
You around?
"If you are, and want to meet with him, maybe the four of us can get on t"
Another email from February 2015 suggested that the Google Chairman remained active in its collaboration with the Clinton campaign: John Podesta wrote that Eric Schmidt met with HR “about the business he proposes to do with the campaign.
He says he’s met with HRC” and adds that “FYI.
They are donating the Google plane for the Africa trip”
"The lead author of the study, Dr. Robert Epstein, has previously conducted research into what he calls the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME)."
"This research showed that the manipulation of results pages in search engines can shift the voting preferences of undecideds by anywhere between 20 and 80 percent, depending on the demographic."
His latest research looks at how search engines can affect voters by suggesting negative or positive search terms when a political candidate’s name is entered into the search bar.

"First censorship, now this."
From Breitbart:
"An email chain among senior Google executives from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton."
"The main email, headlined, “Election results and the Latino vote,” was sent on Nov. 9, 2016—the day after Clinton’s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election—by Eliana Murillo, Google’s Multicultural Marketing department head."
Murillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message:
We worked very hard.
Many people did.
"We pushed tp get out the Latino vote with our features, our partners, and our voices."
"We emphasized our mission to give Latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls, and we feel very grateful for all the support to do this important work."
A large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote.
"We saw high traffic for the search queries ‘votar,’ ‘como votar,’ and ‘donde voter,’ in key states like Florida and Nevada."
We will be pulling in more info in the coming hours/days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish.
Without translating our tools the users wouldn’t have found the information they needed.
"Objectively speaking, our goal was met — we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish, and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work."
"I sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too, and we greatly appreciate it."
"Even Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish, which was really special."
"“Sundar” presumably refers to Google’s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015."
"“Lisa” presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber, the vice president of Global Marketing for Google—who forwarded Murillo’s entire four-page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo’s activities with official company resources as having made a “great difference.” “Philipp” presumably refers to Philipp Schindler, a senior vice president and Google’s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page."
The emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report.
"Breitbart News also obtained them, and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails."
"Carlson, in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night, compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller—raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States."
Epstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections.
"In his report on Monday night, Carlson then described the emails he obtained, which Breitbart News also obtained."
Carlson said:
It wasn’t aimed at all potential voters.
It wasn’t even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups.
Google didn’t try to get out the vote among say Christian Arabs in Michigan or say Persian Jews in Los Angeles—they sometimes vote Republican.
"Furthermore, this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the Hillary campaign."
"This was not an exercise in civics, this was political consulting."
It was in effect an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton campaign.”
"Carlson noted that in communication with Google, the company “did not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference.”"
The email from Murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were:
"We had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media, including YouTubers and influencers like Dulce Candy, Jorge Narvaez, Jessie y Joy, Barbara Bermudo, and Pamela Silva of Univision, Jackie Cruz aka La Flaca from Orange is the New Black, and more."
This reached 4.4M social media impressions and signaled to many that Google and our partners value the Latino community and our role in this election.
"If Murillo had ended her email there, this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story."
Murillo wrote in the next paragraph:
We even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides (with support from HOLA folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help).
We supported Voto Latino to help them land an interview with Senator Meza of Arizona (key state for us) to talk about the election and how to use Google search to find information about how to vote.
"They were a strong partner, among many in this effort."
The next paragraph is where Murillo begins to make her next major admission: that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.
"“Ultimately, after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us,” Murillo wrote."
“We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.
"On the next page, the email continues with a headline from an article in The Atlantic by James Fallows: “2016: The Year Latinos Saved America?”"
"Trump did not end up winning Nevada in the end, but he did beat Clinton in 30 and a half other states."
…
"“We read the headline and thought WOW, we did it!”"
Then she begins writing again: “But then reality set in.
"Only 71% of Latinos voted for Hillary, and that wasn’t enough.”"
"From there, Murillo continues writing for another page and a half:"
"The voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end, most notably in Florida."
"Latino voters voted for Trump more in Florida than in other states (31%), and FL was critical by popular vote and the electoral college."
We’ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election.
We know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next.
Thanks again for all your help and support in this effort.
"“I have tried to stay objective, but I ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect,” Murillo wrote."
"After all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change, the results are not what we expected at all."
"We are afraid for our families, and especially for the millions of immigrants who now don’t know what the future holds for them.”"
Murillo wrote:
What’s most difficult for us is we can’t even email the HOLA list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be Trump supporters.
"One in a remote office said ‘If you guys do any sort of meetings, I’d love to join virtually."
I think I’m currently the only Latinx in my office.
It’s kinda hard.’ #understatement.
She was not done there.
She also says that the company—and herself in particular—will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections.
"“Loss is a part of life, and I do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative."
My partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing — time to keep working harder.”
"“If you see a Latino Googler in the office (California/New York), please give them a smile,” Murillo wrote."
"It’s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this, so we may be even more divided than ever."
"At least in CA/NY though, you can rest assured that the Latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers, at least for them and their families.”"
"Then, she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to “celebrate” a Clinton win, but after Trump won, she says, her vacation “will be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times.”"
"Murillo, in the next line, reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak."
"“I’m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly, but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust,” she wrote."
"Her original email was forwarded on to other Google executives by the aforementioned Gevelber, according to another email obtained by Breitbart News."
“It’s from Eliana Murillo who runs US Hispanic Marketing on my team and who helped found HOLA our Hispanic ERC.”
"A source close to the White House who has reviewed these emails ahead of their public release told Breitbart News that in a just world this would amount to, at a minimum, a clear violation of campaign finance law governing in-kind contributions to campaigns and causes."

Fox News reports:
"A spokesperson for Feinstein declined Fox News’ request to elaborate on the lawmaker’s statement, but there has been much speculation that she is referring to a secret letter that has been the subject of intrigue on Capitol Hill over the last few days."
"A source familiar with the confirmation proceedings told Fox News that Feinstein received the letter back in July, but did not make its existence known publicly until Thursday."
"According to a report by The Intercept, the letter was relayed to lawmakers by an individual affiliated with Stanford University and concerns an incident involving the 53-year-old Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school."
"According to two officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times, the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and the woman."
"The letter reportedly was given to Feinstein by Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., but has not been publicly disclosed by senators who have seen the document."
"Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said that the letter in question has been referred to the FBI for investigation."
"The FBI conducts background checks on all major government appointees, including Supreme Court nominees."
"“Upon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh’s background file, as per the standard process,” the FBI said in a statement."
"In fact, the FBI has no plans to pursue any investigation regarding the allegation."
According to The Washington Post:
"According to a person familiar with the matter, the FBI does not now plan to launch a criminal investigation of the matter, which would normally be handled by local authorities, if it was within the statute of limitations."
"The FBI instead passed the material to the White House, as an update to Kavanaugh's background check, which already had been completed, the person said."
The move is similar to what the bureau did when allegations were leveled against former White House aide Rob Porter.
... Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed the controversy on Twitter.
“Let me get this straight: this is [a] statement about [a] secret letter regarding a secret matter and an unidentified person.
"Right,” he tweeted sarcastically."
"“I will add: the FBI already performed and has reported on a background investigation on the nominee and thhttp://ericposner.com/is-brett-kavanaugh-an-originalist/is has been made available to all Senators on the Judiciary Committee,” Cornyn wrote."

Brett Kavanaugh accused in letter obtained by FBI of drunkenly forcing himself on woman while in high school; Kavanaugh denies it happened
"According to the New York Daily News, Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, held a woman down, covered her mouth and tried to force himself on her while drunk at a party in high school."
That’s the nexus of a letter allegedly acquired by Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein in July but dropped on the last days before the vote for Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
"The unidentified woman says the incident took place at a party in the early 1980s while Kavanaugh was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Md., according to the NYDN, which claims to have obtained the letter on Friday."
"She alleges Kavanaugh and a friend of his, both of whom had been drinking, cornered her in a room and turned up the music to blur out the sound of her protests."
"Kavanaugh then allegedly covered the woman’s mouth with his hand and attempted to force himself on her, but she says she managed to free herself and bolt out of the room."
“I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”
"Kavanaugh’s friend, who has not been identified, did not outright deny the woman’s claims but told the New Yorker he has “no recollection of that.”"
The woman says she has had to undergo psychological treatment as a result of the incident.
"She first approached her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., about the allegations in July shortly after Trump tapped Kavanaugh to replace outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy."
Eshoo’s office declined to comment.
"The woman’s letter was in turn forwarded to Feinstein, D-Calif., who shared it with the FBI and her Democratic committee colleagues on Wednesday night."
An FBI official told the New York Daily News on Thursday that the letter has not yet resulted in a criminal investigation.
"According to Breitbart, on Friday, 65 women from both the Republican and Democrat parties who have known Kavanaugh since high school defended his character and said he has always behaved “honorably” and treaded “women with respect.”"
"The women also said that Kavanaugh has “stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.”"
"“Judge Kavanaugh has denied this allegation and over 60 women – with a broad range of political views – who’ve known him since high school, have sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee vouching for his integrity and respect for women over that time,” says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network."
They have resorted to peddling an allegation of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh that supposedly occurred while the judge was in high school.
The accuser had refused to identify herself before and during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings.
She conveniently waited until this Sunday to come forward via an on-the-record interview with the Washington Post.
"The accuser’s name is Christine Blasey Ford, a registered Democrat who is currently a California professor teaching clinical psychology."
"I did not do this back in high school or at any time."""
"Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee that heard Judge Kavanaugh’s public testimony earlier this month during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, had received last July a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge, who we now know was Ms. Ford."
"Even though Senator Feinstein had the letter in hand, she never brought up the charge during the public hearing, nor during her own meeting with the judge."
"Instead, Senator Feinstein sat on the letter until late last week, when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman’s wish to keep the matter confidential."
Senator Feinstein turned the letter over to the FBI.
The FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation.
"Senator Feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee or to go public with its existence because “the incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion” and she had already “taken care of it,” according to a source quoted by The New Yorker."
"The New Yorker article, written before Ms. Ford publicly identified herself, provided some details regarding her allegation."
"However, now Ms. Ford has decided to do what she called her “civic responsibility” and tell her own story publicly."
"While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it."
"When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth."
"‘I thought he might inadvertently kill me,’ said Ford."
"‘He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.’” Ms. Ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after “Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.”"
Here is where Ms. Ford’s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart.
"Although Ms. Ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, she “said she does not remember some key details of the incident,” according to the Washington Post article."
"For example, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident.” She also does not remember how she got home."
"Yet she claims to be absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred, was involved in the alleged incident."
"Ms. Ford admitted that she “told no one at the time what had happened to her.” In fact, she said she recalled thinking: “I’m not ever telling anyone this."
"This is nothing, it didn’t happen, and he didn’t rape me.” Even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident, that does not explain why, by her own admission, she “told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,” according to the Washington Post article."
"In other words, the only written documentation Ms. Ford has offered in support of her allegation about the incident she said took place while she was in high school – a therapist’s notes of a couples therapy session occurring 30 years after the alleged incident – did not mention Judge Kavanaugh’s name."
"Judge Kavanaugh has had extensive background checks performed on him in the past for his various federal government positions, including for his current position as a federal appellate court judge, without the accusation ever having surfaced."
"In a letter addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Feinstein, 65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school vouched for his character:"
We are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983.
He was an outstanding student and athlete with a wide circle of friends.
Almost all of us attended all-girls high schools in the area.
"We knew Brett well through social events, sports, church, and various other activities."
Many of us have remained close friends with him and his family over the years.
"Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity."
"In particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect."
"That was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day."
The signers of this letter hold a broad range of political views.
"Many of us are not lawyers, but we know Brett Kavanaugh as a person."
And he has always been a good person.
"They have done so in the face of Judge Kavanaugh’s lifetime record of stellar public service, multiple background checks producing no evidence of sexual misconduct, and the letter written by the 65 women, who knew him when he was in high school and thereafter and who signed their names to a ringing endorsement of his good character."
"Predictably, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats, including Senator Feinstein, have called for the Senate to postpone a vote on Judge Kavanaugh."
"""Senator Grassley must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated,” Senator Schumer said."
"Senator Schumer is fulfilling his promise to oppose Judge Kavanaugh with ""everything I've got."""
"As of now, the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican majority plans to move forward with Judge Kavanaugh's nomination as scheduled."
The Democrats have called upon the Senate to postpone the vote on Kavanaugh.
Establishment Republicans are racing for the exits.
But over what?
"An unprovable accusation from decades ago that the accuser said nothing about until years later, and that is uncorroborated by any other testimony or by the evidence of any similar behavior on Kavanaugh’s part."

"“Weighing the Allegations against Brett Kavanaugh,” by David French, National Review, September 16, 2018:"
They’re serious but not solid.
The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh — outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford — are substantial and serious.
"She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes."
Here’s the core of her story:
"While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it."
"When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth."
"“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California."
"“He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling."
"She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house."
Do not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault.
"I went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale."
Circuit Court of Appeals.
"Since Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot."
"At the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying."
"Yet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred."
"We don’t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court."
"I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton — or for any other politician who’s accused of misconduct."
Is it more likely than not that the allegation is true?
"Given the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment."
I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault.
I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.
But the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men.
Here’s why:
"First, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration."
Did the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred?
"With Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration."
"Here, there was not."
"According to the Washington Post, “Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.”"
That’s almost three decades of silence — three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.
But even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem.
They actually contradict her story on a key detail.
"According to the Post, “The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part."
"Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.” Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh’s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions."
At least the investigation seems somewhat manageable.
"If there were only four boys there, who were the other two?"
Let’s hear from them.
"In fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party."
"Yet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party?"
Would they remember any details at all?
"If another attendee says, “He was totally sober and with me the whole time,” that helps Kavanaugh."
"But the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie — for either person…."

"Trump Orders Declassification Of ‘Russian Probe’ Documents, Including Texts"
The documents to be declassified include all FBI reports on interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all other applications to surveil Carter Page.
"Trump also asked that other important documents be declassified as well, including 21 pages worth of an application for a renewed surveillance warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page, according to Fox News."
The 21 pages Trump wants to be declassified only make up a small part of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in heavily redacted format.
The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.
"According to the redacted version as reported by Fox News, three of the declassified pages contain information included in a section titled “The Russian Government’s Coordinated Efforts to Influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.” That section includes reference to the potential coordination between people associated with Trump’s campaign and the alleged Russian election interference effort."
"White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump had ordered the documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency.”"
"The text messages are to be released “without redaction,” and those include messages from Ohr, Strzok, Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey, and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe."
"Fox News further reported that a source familiar with the timing of the declassification told the media outlet that they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr."
A Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News that the DOJ and FBI “are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”

Just listen to him.
Then he says it’s “ugly” to accuse others of sinning.
We can overlook the fig leaf “whether Francis knows it or not…”.

"I have defended him as long as I could, up until the Chile debacle."
But why is Fisher still “working hard not to assume the worst” when there is no longer anything to assume as the ever-mounting evidence of malintent has been in plain view for years?
But it may already be too late to save a regime whose only defense is not truth but raw power.
"At last count, some 29 bishops have publicly declared Viganò’s allegations against Bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation."
"Now even the distinguished canonist Edward Peters, who is no less than a Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, declares that if Viganò’s allegations are true then Bergoglio must go:"
"Of what was said above concerning resignation from Church office in general, what would not apply to a pope, of all office holders, if he, as alleged by Viganò, from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was [pick a disgusting verb]-ing seminarians?"
Does the historical fact that some pretty bad popes held on to office despite committing various offenses justify other popes acting badly in shirking even the minimal gesture of resigning?
"Believing, as he does, that his claims are correct, Viganò, in calling for Francis’ resignation, has done nothing more or less than exercise his right under canon law “to manifest to the sacred pastors [his] opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make [his] opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful…” 1983 CIC 212 § 3."
"I have not called for Francis’ resignation because I do not know (with the degree of certitude that a lawyer seeks) whether Viganò’s key allegations against Francis are substantially true; most assuredly, however, if I reach the conclusion that they are true, I would say, without hesitation, that Francis should resign."
"Yes, deposition."
The Synod declared that Benedict IX (who had refused to appear) was deposed notwithstanding his attempt to undo his resignation.
"At Henry III’s designation, the German Bishop of Bamberg became Clement II, but he died after only a year, whereupon Benedict reasserted his claim to the papacy for the third time in 1047, only to be driven from Rome again by Imperial troops in 1048."
"Damasus II, another German bishop designated by Henry, reigned for a mere three weeks before dying, whereupon Pope St. Leo IX succeeded to the papacy, reigning until 1054."
"Leo, as John Rao observes, was the first in a line of Popes who “took charge of the movement of innovative Christian restoration” which included a breaking of the dominance of Roman nobility over papal elections."
"(Rao, Black Legends, 147-148)."
"The King of Germany then appointed Clement II as Pope, who promptly crowned the King, Holy Roman Emperor."
"Benedict IX, after the death of Clement, claimed the papacy again!"
The Church to this day recognizes Clement II as a true Pope.”
"Moreover, Benedict IX himself is recognized as a true Pope—a valid but deposed Pope—during three separate periods listed as three distinct pontificates in the canon of Popes."
This was possible owing to the lack of any set canonical form for papal elections; a Pope could gain or regain the office by various machinations.
"Indeed, even the Vatican’s own website states that Benedict was Pope from 1047-1048, the very year of his third ascension to the office from which he was finally driven by force."
"Only with the ascension of Pope Nicholas II in 1059 was it established that henceforth the cardinal-bishops would elect the Pope, with the other cardinals having the right to confirm or veto the nominee."
"By 1100 what we now know as the College of Cardinals, embracing all the cardinals of different titles, had the exclusive right to elect a Pope, and the members of the College “have held it ever since.” (Eric John, The Popes, 181)."
"As Pope Benedict has observed, when it comes to the election of a Pope “the Spirit’s role should be understood in a much more elastic sense, not that he [sic] dictates the candidate for whom one must vote…."
So what can be done to defend the Church against Bergoglio?
"That the mode of papal election by cardinals has persisted for nearly a thousand years has led to the general impression that it pertains to the irreformable divine constitution of the Church, but it certainly does not."
As to matters of purely ecclesiastical law such as this one the Church has always allowed for departures from traditional practice in cases of emergency or grave necessity.
What would be the grounds for a declaration of deposition at such a gathering of prelates?
I am not saying that such a case has been proven.
"Rather, what I am saying is that this hypothetical imperfect council could determine that it has been proven and act accordingly, and that the Church would judge any resulting deposition of Bergoglio in the same manner it judges the deposition of Benedict IX."
"If a synod was able to declare the deposition of a pope in 1046, why not an imperfect council today—or, for that matter, another synod?"
It will be argued that such a deposition would provoke massive schisms in the Church.
"But that would not be the first time that defense of the Church’s common good has done so, as the Great Western Schism demonstrates."
"In any case, this much is certain: barring Bergoglio’s conversion and reversal of course, the Church cannot abide this pontificate any longer."
"One way or another, the Church will have to repel an attacker at her very summit."
"No, Bergoglio must go."
President Trump’s sweeping order this week directing intelligence agencies to declassify documents from the more than 18-month-old investigation related to the Left’s electoral collusion conspiracy theory involving Trump and Russia may shed light on what really happened in the 2016 election.
"Trump criticized how the FBI handled the Russia probe, accusing it of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, and of spying on his campaign."
(Carter Page is not related to Lisa Page.)
This declassification effort won’t make things any worse than they are for President Trump.
Obama wanted “to know everything” the FBI was doing in its investigation into claims that Russia was interfering in the 2016 election.
"(The exact message, time-stamped 1:50 p.m., reads ""Yes, bc potus wants to know everything we are doing."")"
"President Trump ordered that the relevant documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,” read a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders."
"Trump ordered the “immediate declassification” of “pages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page,” “all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation,” and “all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.”"
"Trump also ordered the “the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr.”"
It claims that Trump’s declassification request constitutes improper intervention “in an ongoing law enforcement investigation that may implicate the President himself or those around him.”
"The missive is signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who is vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who is ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence."
Intelligence agencies have already reportedly begun working to carry out the president’s orders and the first set of documents could be made public in a few days.
"“When the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America’s national security interests,” a Justice Department official told Fox News."
“The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”
Coats spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was “working expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.”
According to Fox News:
"The documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant."
The 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format.
The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.
"Ditto for former FBI Director James Comey and one of his deputies, Andrew McCabe."
Establishment Democrats are all over the mainstream media channels calling the act of releasing documents criminal.
﻿
Via Zerohedge…
"Despite President Trump’s Monday order for the “immediate declassification” of sensitive materials related to the Russia investigation, “without redaction,” the agencies involved are planning to do so anyway, according to Bloomberg, citing three people familiar with the matter."
"The Justice Department, FBI and Office of the Director of National Intelligence are going through a methodical review and can’t offer a timeline for finishing, said the people, who weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the sensitive matter."
–Bloomberg
"Also ordered released are specific pages from the FBI’s FISA surveillance warrant application on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, as well as interviews with Ohr."
The DOJ and the FBI are expected to submit proposed redactions to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence – which will prepare a package for Trump to sign off on.
"“When the president issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America’s national security interests,” a Justice Department spokesman said in a statement."
“The department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the president’s order.”
The agencies are likely to cite national security concerns over revealing classified “sources and methods” pertaining to the Russia investigation – which will put them in direct conflict with Trump’s order.
"Trump, as president, has the power to override the agencies and declassify material on his own."
"Trump’s order to release the documents comes after months of requests from GOP lawmakers, while the DOJ has repeatedly denied their requests for more transparency."
"After taking in over $400,000 from the Obama Pentagon under the auspices of a research contract, Halper befriended and spied on members of the Trump campaign, including aides Carter Page and George Papadopoulos."
Showdown?
Showdown?
"In letter, Pelosi/Schumer/Schiff/Warner order intel agencies to ignore presidential order on declassification until consulting with Congress."
"https://t.co/x7JDUJd4t0 pic.twitter.com/o64PC7EEFQ — Byron York (@ByronYork) September 19, 2018"
"“Any decision by your offices to share this material with the President or his lawyers will violate longstanding Department of Justice polices, as well as assurances you have provided to us.”"

Kavanaugh Battle Brews
And so far it appears they’re succeeding.
"If Kavanaugh isn’t in place a week from Monday, the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded."
"The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have only been eight justices in place."
Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.
Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to take control from Republicans.
Election Day is November 6.
"The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49."
Christine Blasey Ford’s lawyers are trying to game the system.
They know that Senate Judiciary Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to provide a full week’s notice for a hearing.
"So, if, for example, the committee followed the rules and agreed Friday (today) to a hearing, the soonest it could be held would be next Friday, the final business day before the Supreme Court’s new term begins."
New demands and fake emergencies are bound to arise from Ford’s legal team.
It was unclear at press time if the public hearing scheduled for Monday into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh would go forward.
Kavanaugh informed the committee he was willing to testify Monday.
"“I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,"" he wrote in a letter."
"Ford's lawyer Debra Katz told the Judiciary Committee her client ""wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety."""
Another Ford attorney reportedly said Wednesday that there are “multiple witnesses” who need to testify.
"""A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,” Katz wrote in a letter."
“Dr.
Ford has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested.
Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.”
"GOP lawmakers are figuring out how to respond to Ford’s request, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports:"
"Late Thursday, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman, said that his staff had discussed the issue with Ford’s attorney earlier in the day and that he would consult with his fellow committee members about the next move."
Ford’s offer also increased the pressure on several key moderates — particularly GOP Sens.
Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — whose votes will probably be needed to put Kavanaugh on the high court.
"The sexual assault allegation, which the nominee has denied, has upended his seemingly sure-bet confirmation and only increased the stakes for the key lawmakers."
Chairman Grassley had imposed a Thursday deadline for Ford to submit testimony after her team said Tuesday she wasn’t willing to testify until the FBI investigates her sexual abuse allegations against Kavanaugh.
"Ford “really doesn’t want to testify,” he said."
"Besides, diGenova explained, the eleventh-hour sexual abuse claim leveled against Kavanaugh is a non-federal matter and in this case the alleged assault hasn’t even been clearly outlined by the alleged victim."
"Ford didn’t report it to anyone for decades and isn’t even certain when or where it happened, so the FBI can’t investigate the matter “because there is nothing to investigate.”"
Kavanaugh has already undergone six FBI background checks and the agency has ruled out investigating Ford’s allegation of drunken groping at a teenagers’ party 36 years ago.
"At the White House on Wednesday, President Trump said it would be ""wonderful"" if Ford testifies and ""unfortunate"" if she does not."
"He indicated he was keeping an open mind about the allegations but that it was ""very hard for me to imagine anything happened"" between her and the nominee."
"""This is a very tough thing for him and his family and we want to get over it but at the same time we want to give tremendous amounts of time."
"If she shows up that would be wonderful – if she doesn't show up that would be unfortunate."""
"CBS News reports that Judge Kavanaugh's wife, Ashley Kavanaugh, has received multiple threats."
CBS News has confirmed that the U.S.
"Marshal's Service has assigned a protective detail to Kavanaugh's family,” the news website reports."
Here's what that might look like:
Defense Attorney : When did this occur Ms. Ford?
Ms. Ford : I'm not exactly sure.
I believe it was 1982.

Defense Attorney : Where did it happen?
Ms. Ford : At a house in our town.
I'm not sure whose house it was or where it was.
I don't remember how I got there.
"But, I can tell you that it had a swimming pool and I recall a narrow stairway."
Defense Attorney : Who was present in the house?
"Ms. Ford : Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, two other boys and another girl."
Defense Attorney : What are the names of the other boys and the girl who were present?
Ms. Ford : I don't remember.
Defense Attorney : Were you hurt?
Ms. Ford : No.
"Most victims of sexual assault remember every detail – yes, even years later."
No jury would send a young man to prison based on that testimony.
"Ben Shapiro spoke to Fox News' Martha MacCallum and said ""you have to have some evidence before you destroy a man's life."""
Shapiro's comments can be heard in the video below.
"Jeanine Pirro spoke to Hannity on Thursday night and asked, ""Since when does truth and justice or guilt and innocence depend on your political party."
She continued.
I don't want these people to sit on juries.
It's no longer about truth and justice.
"It's about politics."""
"Hannity asks, ""Why are people willing to throw out due process, equal justice under the law and the presumption of innocence?"""
Their commentary on the video below is interesting.
Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) is to be commended on his handling of the situation.
"In the spirit of compromise, he called off the Senate committee vote that had been on the calendar for Thursday and scheduled a hearing for next Monday so that both Christine Ford and Brett Kavanaugh could state their cases."
Kavanaugh immediately responded to Grassley.
"For 36 hours, there was silence from the Ford camp."
"Then, their demands began."
"First, it was reported that Ford would answer questions, but only at a closed hearing and only after an FBI investigation had been completed."
"Republicans felt that the request for a closed hearing was reasonable, but the demand for a new FBI investigation was not."
The FBI investigates federal crimes and/or national security issues.
"When the FBI received Dianne Feinstein’s letter last week, they forwarded it to the White House to place in Kavanaugh’s background check file."
"(Note: The FBI has already conducted six background checks on Kavanaugh, the most recent one was done this summer.)"
It was announced later that Sen. Grassley would not change the date of the hearing set for Monday.
"Even Senators Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and Lindsey Graham, who have all said Ford needs to be heard, have indicated that if she does not show up for Monday's hearing, they will schedule a vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation."
"And she will only be questioned by members of the Senate panel, not outside lawyers."
"In order to avoid the criticism that will no doubt come anyway, the Republicans on the Senate Judicial committee have tried very hard to oblige Ford's requests, even offering to go to California to hear her testimony."
"She and her attorneys feel that they are in the driver's seat and thus, can call all the shots."
The accuser doesn’t get to determine when and who investigates.
"In addition to the political reasons for the delay requests, it appears as if this woman is reluctant to testify under oath, possibly because she doesn’t want to perjure herself."
Maybe she realizes the magnitude of what her accusations have unleashed.
Either this did not happen at all or a much milder version of the situation she alleges occurred.
Kavanaugh may have made a pass at her as 17-year-old boys (and even some 17-year-old girls) are known to do.
Ford said no and that was it.
"Even she admits, they did not have sex, nor was this a hostage situation."
The perception of events by a 15-year-old girl may differ significantly from reality.
"And 36 years can distort memories, one way or another."
"Whatever happened or did not happen, it's difficult to feel sorry for someone who comes forward at such a politically opportune moment."
Democrats may be overestimating the strength of their hand.
"Ford can choose to state her case on Monday or not, but she is not in a position to be calling the shots."

"— Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) September 21, 2018"
More from the Washington Times:
"Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, has championed Brett Kavanaugh’s #MeToo accuser, but Juanita Broaddrick says the senator never showed any interest in her 1999 rape allegation against President Bill Clinton."
"Ms. Feinstein was elected in 1992, making her one of the few remaining senators who served during independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s investigation into Mr. Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky."
“Not one Democrat would look at my deposition with the independent counsel.
"“Oh, it makes me go back to 1999, when Dianne Feinstein, along with every other Democrat, refused to read my deposition to the independent counsel,” said Ms. Broaddrick told Fox’s Laura Ingraham on Monday."
“They would have nothing to do with it.
"“You voted NOT GUILTY on both counts at Bill Clinton’s impeachment,” she tweeted."
Seems only fair.
"She has long accused Mr. Clinton of raping her a motel room in 1978 in Little Rock, when he was Arkansas attorney general."
"“Go back that far, let’s investigate my situation,” she said on Wednesday."
“Why not?
"Everybody says well it was litigated and adjudicated—my case was never litigated, it was never adjudicated."
It never went to court.
"The allegation went public last week after Ms. Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she received a letter about the incident in late July and referred the matter to federal authorities a week ago."
“She knew this would have a huge effect on her life and she was incredibly brave to come forward.”

President Trump nominated Bret Kavanaugh to the supreme court.
"The power that the Supreme Court has, some would argue, is greater in certain aspects than that of the president himself."
"Trump potentially has the ability to nominate 3 Supreme Court justices during his presidency, thus shaping the laws and morals of this country for about the next 30 years."

Timing
The most suspicious part of this whole situation is the timing.
Christine Ford recalled the incident in 2006
"She's known about this for over ten years, why come forward now?"
She's affiliated with the democratic party and the “resist” movement
"She hired a Clinton attorney, Lisa Banks"
She can produce exactly zero witnesses
Any one of these (and dozens of other) circumstances by themselves are not enough to dismiss this allegation outright.
"Ladies, you demand to be believed, no matter what."
"No, an accusation against a man who has been investigated by the FBI six times prior and has 75 women publicly vouching for his character is not going to stop this process."
Immediately every Democrat publicly stated that they would vote No for his confirmation.
"On the other hand, every Republican publicly stated that they would vote Yes."
"Currently, there's more Republicans in Congress than Democrats, which means the guy will be confirmed."
There's an election 2 months away.
The Democrats think that they'll take back the majority of Congress and will thus be able to block Trump's nomination.
All they have to do is delay the confirmation until after the election.
It’s not difficult to see through this plan.
These are the facts.
This is not my opinion.
Kavanaugh and Last-Minute Accusations
"On Sunday, a former classmate from Judge Kavanaugh's time at Yale accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her at a party."
"The New Yorker has just published an article written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, based on information that was reportedly sent to at least four Democratic senators."
"The article recounted a claim by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh’s, concerning “a dormitory party gone awry.” As the article acknowledged, however, “her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.” The article goes on to say that in her initial conversations with The New Yorker, Ms. Ramirez was “reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty.” It was only after “six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney” that Ms. Ramirez was suddenly able to pinpoint Judge Kavanaugh as having committed an unsavory act, even though she admitted being “foggy” at the time."
The New Yorker article also noted that the magazine “has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.”
"Meanwhile, the ever-present Michael Avenatti, attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend had ""targeted"" women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate ""gang rape."""
"While Judge Kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations, which he adamantly denies, his real test will be on Thursday, assuming that Christine Blasey Ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee."
Her attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that Ms. Ford would testify despite certain “unresolved” issues.
"Among the issues Ms. Ford’s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses, Mark Judge, who Ms. Ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident, as well as “who on the Majority side will be asking the questions, whether senators or staff attorneys."""
A week has already gone by since Ms. Ford went public with her story in an interview with the Washington Post while Ms. Ford and her attorneys stalled for time.
They raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was “bullying” Ms. Ford.
He extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all.
"He had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of California, whichever setting would make her more comfortable."
"However, in Senator Grassley’s e-mail thanking Ms. Ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony, Senator Grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that “the committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, and what order to call them and who will question them."
These are nonnegotiable.”
Some Democrats are already using the Ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh FBI investigation and to postpone Thursday’s scheduled hearing.
Then they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision.
All of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that Judge Kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges – whether proven or not - to sit on the Supreme Court.
Proof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost.
"Regarding Ms. Ford’s accusation, they know that the proof so far is non-existent, aside from Ms. Ford’s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, last July, and in her Washington Post interview."
"While a redacted version of Ms. Ford’s letter has been published, Senator Feinstein has refused to date to give even Senator Grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version."
"The FBI has already conducted 6 background checks, no federal crime is alleged, and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that Ms. Ford cannot even identify."
Ms. Ford cannot corroborate her decades-old charge of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh.
The individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to Senator Feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what Ms. Ford has alleged.
"Moreover, by her own admission to the Washington Post, Ms. Ford “said she does not remember some key details of the incident.” She does not remember, for example, where it happened, how the party came together in the first place, or how she got home after the alleged incident."
"She believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, but reportedly could not be more precise on the day or even the month of the party."
"Moreover, when Ms. Ford finally told someone about the incident in any detail some 30 years later in 2012, during a couples therapy session with her husband, she did not name Judge Kavanaugh specifically, according to the therapist’s notes that Ms. Ford had provided to the Washington Post in connection with her interview."
Ms. Ramirez’s story is even less credible.
It took an attorney and six days of very belated reflection to help revive her memory of an incident she claimed happened while she herself was very drunk.
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is also suffering from the same syndrome.
The same would presumably be the case for Ms. Ramirez.
"They argue that since the Senate Judiciary Committee is not a criminal judicial trial, but rather a legislative hearing for confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, the normal burden of proof shouldered by the accuser should not apply."
"Judge Kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty, they are in effect insisting."
Let’s assume for the sake of argument that the normal burden on the prosecution in a criminal case - to prove the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - is not applicable regarding the charge against Judge Kavanaugh since he is not a defendant in a criminal trial.
"However, that should not flip the burden of proof onto Judge Kavanaugh altogether."
Judge Kavanaugh is being subjected to charges of a criminal nature that could not only deprive him of a seat on the Supreme Court for which he is otherwise eminently qualified.
His family’s lives have been completely upended.
Ms. Ford should have the burden to prove her accusations by at least a preponderance of all the evidence presented.
No more extensions for Ms. Ford to come forward and testify.
"If Ms. Ford does not follow through with her agreement to testify in an open Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday and do so upon the conditions set by the committee, she should go home while the committee proceeds to an immediate vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination."
"If Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh do testify, the senators deciding on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as well as the American public following the testimony must remember one cardinal rule."
Delay is not an option.
"The new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student."
"After stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions, the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands, such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence."
Republicans never seem to learn from their mistakes.
"As usual, Republicans’ seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left."
"Democrats, it turns out, used the extra time created through their delaying tactics to produce two new women with questionable claims against Kavanaugh."
More accusers could be on their way.
"President Trump continues to support Kavanaugh, who maintains his innocence."
"“This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,” the nominee said Sunday of Ford’s accusations."
"“The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so."
"I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name — and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building — against these last-minute allegations.”"
"If Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench on October 1, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term."
"The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have only been only eight justices in place."
Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.
Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans.
Election Day is November 6.
"The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49."
"Meanwhile, the New Yorker magazine reported Sunday that Deborah Ramirez, 53, suddenly claims to have been assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College."
Ramirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.
“I represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge.
"We will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify,” Avenatti wrote on Twitter."
“My client is not Deborah Ramirez.”
"Washington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed, or at least they did before the two new accusers popped up."
"For example, at a Friday afternoon preview of upcoming cases in the Supreme Court’s approaching October term that was hosted by the Federalist Society, panelist Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell predicted that the high court would have nine members again soon."
“I think we ought to recognize that.
"The prospect that the Democrats will take the Senate, albeit thin, is realistic, and so they will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that there is a ninth member of the court there by the time a Democratic majority could take over in the Senate in January.”"
We’ll see soon enough if Goldstein’s prediction comes true.
Stop Appeasing the Democrats
Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.
"From the playground to geopolitics, appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression."
This timeless truth of human nature is one that we moderns can’t seem to accept.
"Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court illustrate that this false assumption leads only to more demands, and ultimately to defeat."
Feinstein still hasn’t given the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of the letter.
"A few weeks after Ford went public, and after Kavanaugh said he had dairies from that summer detailing his whereabouts, The New Yorker published Ramirez’s account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to Ramirez."
"Of course, after each concession comes another demand."
"Wait until Dr. Ford feels that she can come before the committee.” Ford doesn’t “feel” like she can testify on Monday because she’s afraid of flying, despite offers from the Committee to travel to her in California."
"Then she feared for her life because of death threats ––threats also made to Kavanaugh, his wife and two young daughters–– so she now demands enhanced security measures."
The Committee caved and moved the date to Thursday.
"So of course, Grassley having been intimidated into giving Ford a chance to address the Committee, Ramirez and her handlers are now demanding the same privilege."
"Ford and Dianne Feinstein also keep demanding an FBI investigation, even though no federal crime is being alleged, and any investigation 36 years after the offense is impossible."
"Ford can’t remember where and when the alleged assault took place, nor how she got to or went home from the party where it allegedly occurred."
She told no one about the assault until 30 years later.
"A “lifelong friend” whom Ford claims was at the party has denied any knowledge of the it, and says she’s never met Kavanaugh."
"Another friend who reported that the school was abuzz with gossip about the attack (which apparently took place during summer break), retracted her statement."
The two men Ford named as possible witnesses to the assault have contradicter her claims under oath.
"Given that 36 years have passed since the incident, and the accuser’s memory is so hazy and short on coherent details, the FBI has nothing to investigate."
Ramirez’s charge is even flimsier.
Here’s a catalogue from the Daily Wire:
1.
The New Yorker could not find a single witness who could put Kavanaugh at the alleged party.
2.
The New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirez’s claims.
3.
The man accused of egging on Kavanaugh denied Ramirez's allegations and vouched for Kavanaugh’s character.
4.
A third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident.
5.
"Ramirez contacted her former classmates, asking about the incident, and admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the male who exposed himself."
6.
A woman who claims she was “best friends” with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned the story and initially said her friend's accusations against Kavanaugh might be “politically motivated.”
7.
"Ramirez, just like Christine Blasey Ford, is a registered Democrat and is dedicated to leftist causes."
8.
9.
Ramirez admits there are holes in her memory due to how much she drank at the party.
10.
People who knew Ramirez after her time at Yale say that she never once mentioned the incident — until Kavanaugh's nomination was pending.
"No law enforcement agency, let alone the FBI, would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past, and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence."
The “FBI investigation” is another delaying tactic.
"Ford has finally agreed to testify, set for Thursday for now."
Only one camera can be in the room.
"He can’t be in the room with her, apparently because she’s still traumatized and may start experiencing flashbacks."
Grassley shouldn’t cave on these conditions.
They all comprise the old tactic of serially escalating demands that cannot be satisfied in order to compel your enemy to give in.
"If Ford actually testifies on Thursday, or Ramirez is granted the same concession, nothing material will be gained."
Her accusation will not be proved true or false.
But vetting Kavanaugh’s qualifications isn’t the point.
The point is to delay confirmation by slandering Kavanaugh and baiting the Republicans into appearing to abuse victims of sexual assault.
Why?
The courts and especially the Supreme Court have been critical to the progressives’ program since Woodrow Wilson.
The biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the Constitution.
Its divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power.
Hence the Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure.
"But if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench, who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress’s law-making powers."
The irony is that today’s feminists have been willing to sacrifice the earlier narrative of female power and agency that had been stifled by traditional views of the sexes and their capabilities.
"Women have exchanged one form of dependence, and one double standard for another."
"It’s the new third rail of American politics, one that transcends party affiliation."
"Hence the widespread virtue-signaling on the part even of conservative writers who preface their comments about Ford and Ramirez with prologues full of truisms about how horrible sexual assault is, how its self-proclaimed victims “must be heard,” and how churlish and sexist it is to question the truth of any charge."
Grown-ups know all that and don’t have to be reminded every time the subject arises.
"The progressive party can dare the Republicans to ignore the endless specious demands, stop the show-trial, and proceed to a vote on Kavanaugh, because they know the Republicans, fearful of the “optics,” will cave."
Just stop holding them.
"Invite written questions from the Senate, then schedule one day for the nominee to respond."
"Don’t put it on television, but make public a written transcript."
No more concessions.
No more delays.
Don’t give Ramirez the time of day.
"Hold the vote no later than Thursday, or Friday if Ford does show up."
"Make Senators go on the record with their votes, and hold them to account in November."
Whether the claims are true is irrelevant to these people.
Only the seriousness and luridness of the charges matter as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle.
They don’t care about the victims they create.
Only the headlines.
"The third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped."
"Incredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway."
It gets weirder.
"He drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said."
"""I don't know who this is and this never happened,"" the judicial nominee added."
A CNBC summary describes Swetnick:
"A 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies."
"Swetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s ""drink excessively at many"" house parties in suburban Maryland."
"At the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school."
"She said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in ""abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,"" which ""included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent"" and ""not taking 'No' for an answer."""
"Predictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either ""immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations."""
There is no indication so far that the president will oblige them.
"""There should be an immediate investigation"" of Swetnick’s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, ""and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court."""
"“All of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,” Trump said."
"A fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports."
According to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee:
"An anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner’s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states."
"Kavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC."
"Depending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh."
The newspaper account continues:
"The transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators."
And GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).
"Accuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday."
Ramirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.
She claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.
"If Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term."
"It normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices."
Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.
Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans.
Election Day is November 6.
"The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49."
The proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.
"“It is going against everything I’ve seen for 44 years,"" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)."
"""They’re not following normal procedure."""
"As expected, at today’s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him."
"According to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:"
I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford.
I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.
But I have never done that to her or to anyone.
"Kavanaugh added: ""I am innocent of this charge."""
Not surprisingly Ford’s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.
"“I am here today not because I want to be,” Ford says in her opening statement."
I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”
"Many commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties."
Both women are college professors.
Both claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles.
Ford claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace.
An abused person wouldn’t do that.
"In the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991."
"If they can derail Kavanaugh’s nomination, that is an added bonus."
"The Left’s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests:"
"Disapproval for Kavanaugh … is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll."
"Those surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began."
"That said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m."
"""If we're ready to vote, we will vote,” Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. “If we aren't ready, we won't.”"
"Obviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation."
"“We're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power,"" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday."
"""And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court."""
President Trump quoted the nation’s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday:
Trump is right.
"Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ"
"Archbishop Viganò has released a new, powerful statement necessitated by the peculiar reaction of Pope Francis to the Aug 22 Testimony."
"The former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States has, as they say, doubled down."
Read the Archbishop’s words for yourselves and note well the ring of truth that resonates in every sentence.
"Friends, let us pray for Archbishop Viganò."
"He is standing against corrupt men in high places who cannot be trusted to do what is best for souls, for the Catholic faithful or indeed for Holy Mother Church herself."
"God bless you, Your Excellency, and Mary keep you."
We are with you!

"It has been a month since I offered my testimony, solely for the good of the Church, regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23, 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington, in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital."
"Well aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have, because what I was about to reveal involved the successor of Peter himself, I nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the Church, and I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true."
"Christ died for the Church, and Peter, Servus servorum Dei, is the first one called to serve the spouse of Christ."
"Certainly, some of the facts that I was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that I had promised to observe and that I had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the Holy See."
"But the purpose of any secret, including the pontifical secret, is to protect the Church from her enemies, not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members."
"2491), the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth."
Only the seal of confession could have justified my silence.
"Neither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony."
"“Qui tacet consentit” surely applies here, for if they deny my testimony, they have only to say so, and provide documentation to support that denial."
"If he had said: “Viganò lied,” he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own."
In so doing he would have intensified the demand of the people of God and the world for the documentation needed to determine who has told the truth.
"Instead, he put in place a subtle slander against me — slander being an offense he has often compared to the gravity of murder."
"Indeed, he did it repeatedly, in the context of the celebration of the most Holy Sacrament, the Eucharist, where he runs no risk of being challenged by journalists."
"When he did speak to journalists, he asked them to exercise their professional maturity and draw their own conclusions."
"Moreover, the pope’s cover-up of McCarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake."
These include his role in the case of Fr.
"Julio Grassi in Buenos Aires, his reinstatement of Fr."
"Mauro Inzoli after Pope Benedict had removed him from ministry (until he went to prison, at which point Pope Francis laicized him), and his halting of the investigation of sex abuse allegations against Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor."
"In the meantime, a delegation of the USCCB, headed by its president Cardinal DiNardo, went to Rome asking for a Vatican investigation into McCarrick."
"I would like to make a special appeal to Cardinal Ouellet, because as nuncio I always worked in great harmony with him, and I have always had great esteem and affection towards him."
"He will remember when, at the end of my mission in Washington, he received me at his apartment in Rome in the evening for a long conversation."
"At the beginning of Pope Francis’ pontificate, he had maintained his dignity, as he had shown with courage when he was Archbishop of Québec."
"Your Eminence, before I left for Washington, you were the one who told me of Pope Benedict’s sanctions on McCarrick."
You have at your complete disposal key documents incriminating McCarrick and many in the curia for their cover-ups.
"Your Eminence, I urge you to bear witness to the truth."

"On multiple occasions, Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state’s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens."
"As Reason points out, in 2010 he dissented from the D.C. Circuit’s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer’s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant."
Kavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person’s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn’t constitute a “search” as defined by the Fourth Amendment.
"To Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is “constitutional.” In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone’s physical property, or track someone’s cell phone."
"Luckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this."
"In June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant."
But it gets worse.
"In 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA’s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is “entirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.” To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens’ phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure."
"According to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches “without individualized suspicion” when the government demonstrates a “special need” that “outweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.”"
"“The sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,” Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh’s views on the disposable nature of the constitution."
"Kavanaugh “has no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a “counterterrorism exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement,” said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program."
Representative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed.
"However, this hasn’t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court."
"“There are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations."
"Indeed, as technology increases, so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us."
The cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep.

Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s outstanding performance at yesterday’s evidentiary hearing featuring attempted rape accuser Christine Blasey Ford may have revived his embattled nomination for the highest court in America.
The meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the underhanded tactics employed by the Left against Judge Kavanaugh.
President Trump was delighted.
"“Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him[,]” President Trump tweeted at 6:46 p.m. after the hearing wrapped up."
"“His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting."
"Ford, who claims Kavanaugh tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for several hours Thursday."
Kavanaugh testified separately after Ford’s testimony concluded.
The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment.
But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking.
Those efforts didn't work.
"When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed."
Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready.
"This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee, and by staff."
It would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits.
"When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes."
Opinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed.
"She tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself, instead focusing on process-related questions, presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process."
"Ford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh’s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later."
It’s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers.
She could do little else.
She had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.
As commentator Sean Davis tweeted:
"Nonetheless, Mitchell’s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in."
"In the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh."
Whether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh’s side remains to be seen.
"“No, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,” Ford replied."
"When Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford “with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?” Ford replied, “one hundred percent.”"
"She doesn’t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is “one hundred percent” certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her."
"At the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through –including the Democrats’ sordid behavior— since President Trump announced the judge’s nomination on July 9."
"As part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993."
"Ford shared her allegations in a letter to the committee’s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer."
"The letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said."
"Instead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing."
"Before the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn’t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August."
The committee held a four-day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public.
"Feinstein didn’t attend it, Grassley said."
"Kavanaugh answered almost 1,300 written questions senators submitted after the hearing."
"That is “more than all prior Supreme Court nominees,” he said."
"“Throughout this period, we did not know about the ranking member's secret evidence."
"Then, only at an 11th hour, on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI."
"And then, sadly, the allegations were leaked to the press.”"
"“Every step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation,” Grassley said."
"After Ford’s identity became public, Grassley’s staff “contacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article,” he said."
Kavanaugh “immediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements.
He denied the allegations categorically.”
"“Democratic staff was invited to participate and could have asked any questions they wanted to, but they declined."
"Grassley said his staff contacted the other individuals who allegedly attended the party at which the conduct Ford complained of allegedly took place: Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Keyser."
"“All three submitted statements to the Senate under – under penalty of felony, denying any knowledge of the events described by Dr. Ford."
"Dr. Ford's lifelong friend, Dr. – Miss Keyser, stated she doesn't know Judge Kavanaugh and doesn't recall ever attending a party with him.”"
"Grassley said his staff repeatedly sought to interview Ford over the past 11 days, “even volunteering to fly to California to take her testimony, but her attorneys refused to prevent – present her allegations to Congress.”"
"“Consistent with their stated desires to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination” by any means possible, “pushed for FBI investigations into the allegations.”"
"“We've been trying to investigate other allegations,” Grassley said."
"“At this time, we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients, and they have made no attempt to substantiate their claims.”"
"Attorneys for new Kavanaugh accusers Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have been approached by committee staff on eight and six occasions, respectively, Grassley said."
“Neither attorney has made their clients available for interview.
"Lashing out at Democrats, Graham said, “If you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us."
"“God, I hope you never get it."
Graham warned fellow GOPers about voting against the nomination.
You want this seat?
"“It certainly has brought us no closer to the truth,” Hatch added."
The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination today at 9:30 a.m.
"Asked last night about the nomination moving to the floor of the Senate for a final vote, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) reportedly answered, ""Depends on what happens tomorrow."""
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is planning a procedural vote on Saturday to formally move to the nomination, followed by a potential confirmation vote by the full Senate as soon as Tuesday, Politico reports."
"If Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term."
"It normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices."
Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.
Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to seize control from Republicans.
Election Day is November 6.
"The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49."
The confirmation drama continues.
Senate Judiciary Committee Vote To Send Kavanaugh Nomination To The Floor
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-10 along party lines to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh out of committee to the Senate floor for a vote.
"Of course, RINO Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) wanted to side with Senate Democrats in pushing for a FBI investigation into unsubstantiated allegations against Kavanaugh."
"Flake said that he believed it would be proper to delay the floor vote to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation ""limited in time"" to no more than one week."

Comfort?
It's a good thing he'll be leaving the Senate.
"Why that investigation is needed is unclear since all the people Dr. Christine Ford named to be at the alleged house where the alleged attack took place all categorically denied the attack took place, including Ford's girl friend."
The committee also voted against Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and his motion to subpoena Mark Judge before the committee.

I'll Say What Kavanaugh Wouldn't: Christine Ford Was Part Of The Political Hit On Him & Here's The Audio Evidence
I don't say this lightly.
There are many things that we heard from Ford on Thursday that indicate there is more going on than she was willing to say.

"However, Ford claims she never authorized her July letter to Senator Feinstein to be made public and yet, it was."
She didn't seem distraught over that.
"“I do think that over the coming days and weeks there will be a strategy that will emerge, and I think it’s possible that strategy might ultimately defeat the nominee,” Seidman said in audio that was recorded by the Republican National Committee’s War Room."
Kavanaugh even responded by pointing out that even her friends said they don't recall such an incident and had literally hundreds of people commend his character as the direct opposite of what Ford claims.
It's wrong.
Nope.
"She went to her US Democrat representative, Senator Dianne Feinstein and The Washington Post."
"If that is not political, I don't know what is."
Kavanaugh's nomination was passed out of committee on Friday and will go to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote.

“I’ve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh’s file.
"As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week,” the president said in a statement."
The scope and one-week limitations were what Senator Jeff Flake proposed just prior to the vote that passed the Kavanaugh nomination out of committee and to the Senate for a vote on his confirmation.

"On top of that, there has been zero evidence submitted to the committee that Ford's allegations are true."
"In fact, everything submitted has refuted her claims, from sworn statements by those she claims were there to Kavanaugh's calendar to character statements by dozens of women who have known him since high school to those he has worked with in DC."
"All of the people named by Ford have already submitted statements that they have no memory of the event ever occurring, including a female friend of hers at the time."
Two of those named have stated that they will cooperate with the FBI.
"“I will cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations,” Kavanaugh friend Mark Judge said."
"“My client, Patrick J. Smyth, is happy to cooperate fully with this FBI investigation,” said attorney Eric B. Bruce."
Kavanaugh also said he would be cooperating as he has in the past.
"“Throughout this process, I’ve been interviewed by the FBI, I’ve done a number of ‘background’ calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,"" Kavanaugh said in a statement that was released by the White House."

"Dina Powell, a Valerie Jarrett/Huma Abedin Pal, Should Not Be UN Ambassador"
President Trump came in promising to drain the swamp.
"You can see her out there at the Clinton Global Initiative, next to Samantha Power, palling around with Valerie Jarrett or Huma Abedin."
Dina Habib Powell was an influential figure in the Bush administration.
The Egyptian-American immigrant had served as a gatekeeper for George W. Bush.
"If you wanted a job, you went through her."
"Barely 30, Habib Powell had more power than many of the big Bush era names you do know."
Then she took on the mission of promoting America to the Muslim world at the State Department.
There were cultural exchanges with Iran and money for Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority.
Afterward it was off to make millions through philanthropy at the Goldman Sachs Foundation.
Habib Powell had all the right friends.
Like Valerie Jarrett.
Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in.
Her ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin.
"You could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess."
You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala.
The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi’s American Committee on Jerusalem.
Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal.
And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO’s Hanan Ashrawi.
"Unlike McFarland, Habib Powell had no national security background."
"But though her parents were Christians, she had the “right” views on Islam."
"In Egypt, she had described how Bush after September 11 had, “visited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.” ""I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year.” Habib Powell had attended such an iftar dinner."
Habib Powell has been described as the Republican Huma Abedin.
And Powell has been on cheerful terms with at least one Obama unmasker.
And with Clintonworld people.
"In 2015, Dina Powell – President Donald Trump’s Deputy National Security Adviser in 2017 – sat down with far left-wing United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power for an interview."
"In that interview, Powell heaped effusive praise upon Power and can be seen nodding in agreement throughout."
Power was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.
"At the time, Powell – an executive with Goldman Sachs – was pushing a pet project known as 10,000 women, which is ostensibly intended to foster female entrepreneurship."
"When Powell was at Goldman Sachs, her right-hand woman in the 10,000 Women program was Noa Meyer."
"Perhaps not so coincidentally, Meyer worked in the Bill Clinton administration’s speech-writing office of then first-lady Hillary Clinton."
"Powell herself, is very comfortable with Hillary Clinton."
"In 2013, she shared a stage with Hillary at the Clinton Global Initiative."
"In fact, Barack Obama’s closest adviser Valerie Jarrett introduced Powell, who returned the introduction with effusive praise for Jarrett."
"The ex-Goldman Sachs executive has befriended Obama’s closest adviser, Valerie Jarrett."
She is also very cozy with Hillary Clinton’s closest advisers Huma Abedin and Philippe Reines.
Now there's once again talk of moving Dina Powell in.
This time into Nikki Halley's old spot as UN Ambassador.
The talk comes from the GOP establishment.
"Powell should not be at the NSC, where she replaced K.T."
"McFarland, who was qualified for the job, at the behest of H.R."
McMaster.
But every job for Powell is a stepping stone to the next one.
Making Dina Powell the US Ambassador to the UN would quickly undo all the progress that Haley made.
Haley sent a message that UN members will be punished if they push the US around.
Dina Powell would have been a Jeb Bush appointee.
You don't drain the swamp by appointing the swamp.
The rumor that Dina Habib Powell is the top candidate to replace outgoing U.S.
One hopes the rumor mill is wrong.
Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment.
"Back in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared."
"McMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers."
McMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were “irreligious.”

McMaster forced out superb K.T.
When President Trump finally replaced national security adviser H.R.
Why would President Trump go back to there?

"While President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged onCNN, “Over 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.” (CFP)"
"Two separate National Security Council sources have confirmed that National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster and Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell have been leaking negative material about President Donald J. Trump to their allies in the anti-Trump media,"

Powell has close ties to the Clintons.
Breitbart:
"1 – When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women’s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman’s foundation."
2 – Powell’s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects.
3 – Powell’s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation.

"5 – Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chief, John Podesta."
"On May 11, 2009, Powell was one of ten speakers at a Clinton Global Initiative event co-sponsored with the Economist titled, “Global Challenges, Corporate Solutions: Creating Value for Business and Society.” Other speakers included Bill Clinton and Clinton’s former chief of staff, John Podesta, who at the time was president and chief executive officer of the George Soros-financed Center for American Progress and co-chairman of the Obama White House transition team."
Podesta would later become chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.
"Powell also served as a panelist at the second annual Women in the World Summit in 2011, which was keynoted by Hillary Clinton."
"The summit was launched by longtime Clinton ally Tina Brown, who also founded the Daily Beast, where Powell was a contributor."
"6 – There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell’s 10,000 Women and the Clintons."

"Ambassador Nancy Powell, America’s representative in Pakistan, refused to allow the distribution in Pakistan of wanted posters, matchbooks, and other items advertising America’s $25 million reward for information leading to the capture of Mr. bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders."
"Instead, thousands of matchbooks, posters, and other material – printed at taxpayer expense and translated into Urdu, Pashto, and other local languages – remained “impounded” on American Embassy grounds from 2002 to 2004, according to Rep. Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois."
"While the American government was engaged in a number of “black” or covert intelligence activities to locate Al Qaeda leaders, Mr. Kirk said, the “white” or public efforts – which have succeeded in the past in leading to the capture of wanted terrorists – were effectively shut down in the months following the September 11 attacks."

"Powell, who returned to Goldman in a senior role after leaving her job as President Donald Trump’s deputy national security adviser, is said to be strongly considering the job but also weighing family concerns."
"Powell already lives in New York, where the U.N. is based, but has young children and left the administration in part to spend more time with family."
She is also said to be happy in her job at Goldman.
"Born in Egypt and raised in the United States, Powell is well liked by Trump as well as the president’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner."
Trump on Tuesday described Powell as a “person I would consider” when asked about her possible nomination.
“She is under consideration.
"We have, actually, many names,” he said."
"However, according to Bloomberg, Powell isn't interested in the position."
She says she is just fine at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Dina Powell has told some colleagues that she’s leaning against leaving the firm to rejoin the Trump administration as ambassador to the United Nations, according to two people familiar with the matter."
"President Donald Trump has called Powell about the job twice, first on Sunday -- before current United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley announced her resignation -- and again on Wednesday, the people said."
"He made it clear that he’s interested in the idea of appointing Powell to the position, they said, though he has also talked to other candidates."

No sign of breakthrough after Pompeo meets with Saudi rulers over missing journalist
"Pompeo did not report any progress following a day of meetings in Riyadh with Saudi King Salman and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler."
"In his meetings, Pompeo conveyed “U.S."
"concern” about Khashoggi’s disappearance two weeks ago, the State Department said, and stressed “the importance of a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation.”"
"The talks were “direct and candid,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said."
"Pompeo reminded his hosts that despite the numerous bilateral issues the two governments share, determining Khashoggi’s fate was the urgent purpose of this trip, she said."
"Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the autocratic Saudi leadership, was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2, where he was seeking papers to marry his fiancée."
"A 15-member Saudi military team had entered the consulate with a bone saw shortly before Khashoggi arrived, and flew out of the country soon after, the reports said."
Saudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence.
They have denied any responsibility for his disappearance.
"Hoping to stem a growing furor, Trump on Monday suggested “rogue killers,” not the Saudi royal family, may have carried out the murder."
"Critics quickly said that Trump was providing an excuse for the Saudi leaders, and participating in a cover-up."
"They floated the idea later Monday of claiming that Khashoggi, who wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and Arab media, was accidentally killed in an interrogation gone awry inside the consulate — supposedly without the approval of the king or crown prince."
"Publicly, Pompeo and his hosts looked calm and friendly when they met Tuesday in Riyadh."
"At one point, as they greeted each other, Prince Mohammed noted the two countries were important allies."
"“Absolutely,” Pompeo said, smiling."
The United States long guaranteed Saudi security in exchange for a steady supply of oil.
Those ties have frayed even as the Trump administration has embraced the Saudi rulers as a crucial regional ally in efforts to constrain Iran and to craft a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians.
"The current crisis has put those broader goals at risk, and the White House has scrambled to find a face-saving solution for the Saudi rulers."
He has ruled out cancelling or suspending billions of dollars in arms deals with the oil-rich country.
"Many members of Congress have demanded the White House take tougher actions, including punitive sanctions on Saudi rulers."
But Congress has taken no action on its own.

Pompeo offers defense for Saudi rulers as Trump administration strategy shifts in Khashoggi case
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo expressed confidence Wednesday that the Saudi government could be trusted to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist in a Saudi diplomatic facility in Turkey — despite the likelihood that senior Saudi officials were involved.
"Speaking in Ankara, Turkey, Pompeo offered that support hours after President Donald Trump had mounted an even stronger defense for the Saudi rulers, saying, “Here we go again with you’re guilty until proven innocent.”"
"The dissident journalist, who lived in Virginia, vanished Oct. 2 after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey."
Neither Trump nor his top diplomat offered any new facts or insights in the case.
"But unless authorities recover his body or other conclusive evidence of his death, the mystery may remain unsolved."
"Pompeo wrapped up two days of emergency talks in the region — first with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh, and then with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara — and headed back to Washington on Wednesday."
Turkish crime scene investigators and forensic specialists were allowed to search for evidence in the Saudi consulate and a nearby residence on Tuesday.
Erdogan later complained that the interior walls had been repainted in recent days.
"He said Saudi leaders made a commitment “to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether they are a senior officer or official.” He said they made “no exceptions,” including presumably members of the royal family."
"Asked if the Saudis had informed him whether Khashoggi was alive or dead, Pompeo said, “I don’t want to talk about any of the facts."
"They didn’t want to either, in that they want to have the opportunity to complete this investigation in a thorough way.”"
"Asked if he believed the Saudi rulers’ repeated denial of complicity, Pompeo said he was reserving judgment."
"“I think that’s — I think that’s — I think that’s a reasonable thing to do, to give them that opportunity,” Pompeo said, “(and then) we’ll all get to evaluate the work that they do.”"
"Pompeo refused to discuss possible consequences for those found responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance, reiterating at least three times the “importance of the investigation.”"
"Later Wednesday, Pompeo said during a refueling stopover in Brussels that Erdogan had informed him the Saudis were cooperating with the Turkish investigation “after a couple of delays.”"
"Turkish officials “seemed pretty confident the Saudis will permit them to do things they need to do to complete” the investigation, Pompeo told reporters traveling with him."
"In a sign that the administration is looking to help Saudi Arabia get out of its dilemma, Pompeo urged Americans to be mindful of the extensive energy, economic and security ties between Riyadh and Washington, including efforts against what he called the world’s largest supporter of terrorism, Iran."
"“We need to make sure we are mindful of that as we approach decisions” on whether to impose sanctions or take other punitive steps against Riyadh, as many in Congress and elsewhere have urged."
"Critics questioned whether the Saudi rulers, who preside over an authoritarian regime that allows little opposition, can be relied on to conduct a credible probe into Khashoggi’s fate — especially without decisive pressure from their close ally, the Trump administration."
Saudi leaders for two weeks denied knowing anything about the Khashoggi case.
"On Monday, they began floating a scenario — initially adopted by Trump — that blamed the murder inside the consulate on “rogue killers,” and then suggested the writer was accidentally killed during an interrogation that went awry."
Analysts familiar with the desert kingdom said it was likely Saudi leaders were hoping the scandal would blow over and that they could wait it out.
"“We received commitments that they would complete this (investigation), and I am counting on them to do that,” Pompeo said."
“They gave me their word.”

Trump threatens military closure at US border to stop migrants
Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote.
"Trump, who ran in 2016 promising to tighten U.S. immigration laws and stanch the inflow of undocumented migrants, has called for cutting off foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador if they don’t stop the migrants."
He claimed Thursday — without providing evidence — that Democrats are backing the human movement to bolster their case for “open borders and existing weak laws.”
"Days ago the president threatened to withhold American aid from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador if the flow of immigrants wasn’t stopped."
"This prompted the Honduran Foreign Ministry to urge its citizens not to join the group, according to Reuters."
Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez said in a public address on Tuesday evening some Hondurans in the caravan had already returned home and the government was preparing to support them.
He did not specify how many had turned back.
"Still, the caravan had grown to about 4,000 people today."
NBC News reported that many of those in the caravan are unaccompanied children.
Mexico is said to have deployed 500 additional federal police to its border with Guatemala in anticipation of the caravan’s arrival.
"On Wednesday, Congressman Matt Gaeetz said video footage shows Honduran women and children were being given cash to join the caravan."
"In first public rebuke by the White House, Mnuchin pulls out of Saudi investment conference to protest Khashoggi case"
"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Thursday he was pulling out of a major Saudi investment conference, known as Davos in the Desert, in the first public rebuke by the White House of the Saudi regime over the disappearance and suspected murder of a dissident Saudi journalist who lived in Virginia."
"Trade and finance ministers from Britain, France, Holland and other countries, the head of the International Monetary Fund, as well as CEOs of multiple major companies already had withdrawn in protest, and Mnuchin was under growing pressure to add his name to the list."
Mnuchin tweeted the decision after meeting with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo at the White House.
"Pompeo later told reporters that he had urged the president to give the Saudi government “a few more days” to explain what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, who vanished after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2."
Khashoggi wrote opinion columns for the Washington Post critical of the Saudi royal family.
"Saudi King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler, have denied to both Trump and Pompeo any knowledge of the alleged murder or having ordered it."
"Pompeo returned Wednesday night from meetings with Saudi and Turkish leaders in Riyadh and Ankara and went to the White House Thursday morning to brief Trump, who has come under mounting pressure from Congress and rights groups to punish Saudi Arabia."
"Pompeo said the Saudis “understand the serious nature” of Khashoggi’s disappearance, and would conduct a thorough and “timely” investigation."
"Their findings, Pompeo said, “will be transparent for everyone to see, to ask questions about, to inquire with respect to its thoroughness.”"
He said he told the president “that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we too have a complete understanding of the facts” before making decisions on how the U.S. should respond.
"Turkey is conducting its own probe, and Pompeo said those results will also be taken into consideration."
"He again stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia as a strategic ally, in a relationship, he noted, that dates back more than 80 years."
"The administration’s reluctance to condemn the Saudi government has fueled criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, from diplomats and from even some corporations that long have profited from close relations with the Saudi royal family."
"“We just are going to allow the process to move forward, allow the facts to unfold,” Pompeo said."

"As Honduran Caravan Reaches The Border, Trump Threatens To Send In The Military"
President Donald Trump has threatened to send the military to the United States’ southern border with Mexico to stop a caravan of illegal immigrants coming from Honduras.
"As of now, the migrant caravan has grown in size to over 4,000 people."
"….In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught – and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!.."
"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018"
"According to Breitbart, the caravan of migrants that began in Honduras has grown to several thousand people after passing into Guatemala as it heads for the Mexican border."
Other Hondurans are leaving the country to join the caravan of illegal immigrants attempting to illegally enter the United States against president Trump’s wishes.
"Trump also threatened to stop all federal foreign aid payments to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador if the countries failed to block the flow of illegal immigrants and blamed Democrats for rejecting a reform of immigration laws allowing them to claim asylum."
He also claimed that the caravan included criminals.
Trump appeared willing to end his new trade deal with Mexico as well if the caravan was not stopped.
All Democrats fault for weak laws!
"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018"
"According to NBC News, the caravan has increased in size to over 4,000."
"The media outlet also reported that the Mexican government has sent 500 additional federal police to its border with Guatemala in anticipation of their arrival, according to U.S. government documents obtained by NBC News."
"Part of the caravan, which has split into two groups, is approaching the Mexico-Guatemala border amid a surge in border crossings on the U.S.-Mexico border."
"In September, U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 41,400 undocumented immigrants, up from 37,544 in August, according to numbers not yet released publicly but obtained by NBC News."
The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the numbers of families and children traveling on their own surged to record levels in September.
Trump Threatens To Send Military To Block Honduran Migrant Caravan
This is the second time a caravan of migrants have gotten together and seem intent on pushing towards and across the US/Mexico border.
"As a result of the news, President Donald Trump has threatened to send the military to the border to block them."
Reuters reports on the caravan.
"More Honduran migrants tried to join a caravan of several thousand trekking through Guatemala on Wednesday, defying calls by authorities not to make the journey after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to cut off regional aid in reprisal."
"Several thousand people are now part of the caravan, according to a Reuters witness traveling with the group in Guatemala, where men women and children on foot and riding in trucks filled a road on their long journey to Mexico."
"In a series of tweets on Thursday, President Trump said the right things."

Hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border.
All Democrats fault for weak laws!
"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018"
"“I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught – and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!” Trump wrote on Twitter."
"“Hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border,” he added."
“All Democrats fault for weak laws!”
"Not only did Trump threaten to send the military to the border, but he also threatened to stop all federal payments to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador if they didn't block the caravan."
"The obvious question I have is: Why are you not stopping those payments now, Mr. President?"
"Trump also seemed ready to back out on his new trade deal, which is hardly a deal for the US, with Mexico if they failed to stop the caravan."
"In fact, every single migrant who crosses over into our country will more than likely commit at least 28 crimes in order to present themselves as legal."
"“The assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in, is far more important to me, as President, than Trade or the USMCA,” he wrote."
We'll see if these countries stop the migrants or if it continues to the border.
"If they make it here and Trump does nothing but arrest them and put them through the system rather than simply turning them away, then you know the words are empty and hollow."
Time will tell what will take place.
Nimesh Patel Stand-Up Routine Cut Short Due To Uncomfortable Jokes
"Nimesh Patel, a comedian known for being the first Indian-American writer for Saturday Night Live, had his stand-up routine at cultureSHOCK cut short earlier tonight due to uncomfortable jokes."
"cultureSHOCK, an event hosted by the Asian American Alliance, is a charity performance showcase that aims to provide a space to celebrate Asian American expression."
Patel was one of the main events promoted beforehand.
Patel questioned why this was happening.
"The organizers replied that the person in charge of tech had to leave early, but Patel continued to claim that he was being cut off because the audience didn’t like his jokes."
"At one point, one organizer told Patel he was being disrespectful."
He tried to continue speaking until his mic was cut.
We have reached out to the Asian American Alliance for comment and were told that their board is not yet prepared to release a statement.
We will update this post if such a statement is forthcoming.

Student organizers boot SNL writer from stage during standup routine for jokes deemed offensive
"Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was pulled from the stage by event organizers after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night."
"Patel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing."
Patel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock.
"During the event, Patel’s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City—including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood—which AAA officials deemed inappropriate."
"About 30 minutes into Patel’s set, members of AAA interrupted the performance, denounced his jokes about racial identities and sexual orientation, and provided him with a few moments for closing remarks."
"Compared to his other jokes, ones specifically targeting sexual orientation audibly receive less laughter from the crowd."
"cultureSHOCK, an annual charity showcase featuring a fashion show, productions by various student groups and a famous performer, aims to provide a platform for Asian American artistic expression and breakthrough harmful stereotypes."
Neither Patel and nor AAA could immediately be reached for comment.
"Adam Warren, CC ‘22, was in the audience Friday night."
"However, audience member Elle Ferguson, BC ‘22, said that while comedians can push the boundaries of social culture, she had heard similar jokes before and did not find them offensive."
"“While what some of the things that he said might have been a bit provoking to some of the audience, as someone who watches comedy a lot, none of them were jokes that I hadn’t heard before and none of them were jokes that elicited such a response in my experience,” Ferguson said."
“[AAA] should have talked to him beforehand especially because comedy is known for being ground-breaking and for pushing boundaries.”
"For Sofia Jao, BC ‘22, problems with the performance resided not in the set, but with Patel’s closing remarks."
“I really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world.
"Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it’s not and continuing to perpetuate the un-safeness of it… is saying that it can’t be changed,” said Jao."
"“When older generations say you need to stop being so sensitive, it’s like undermining what our generation is trying to do in accepting others and making it safer.”"

The Washington Times reports:
A watchdog group filed a Senate ethics complaint Monday against Sens.
Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren for sending out fundraising emails asking for donations to support their votes against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh — even before they cast their votes against him.
"While voting and then asking supporters to back that decision with cash is common, the watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), says asking for money ahead of time crosses the line into vote-buying."
"FACT asked the Senate ethics committee to probe fundraising emails sent by Ms. Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and Ms. Harris, California Democrat."
"Ms. Warren’s email said she was demanding a delay on the judge’s confirmation vote and asked for donations for her 2018 election campaign, while Ms. Harris’s emails detailed several of her actions as a member of the Judiciary Committee, including her questioning of the president’s pick for the high court, and asking for contributions."
"Of course, but like most of these kinds of violations, the only thing that might actually occur here is censure, and that is highly unlikely in the current climate."
"However, voters should be aware of the unethical practice of both of these senators."
"While Harris is not up for re-election this year, Warren is."
"Retailing these poisonous lies ought to hurt her chances for election to Congress, especially after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre."

"On November 16, 2012, Somali-born Minnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), who’s currently running for the state’s 5th Congressional District seat, sent out the following tweet:"
"In May of this year, Twitter user John Gilmore dug up the six-year-old tweet, forcing Omar to defend herself."
She responded: “Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.
"You are a hateful sad man, I pray to Allah you get the help you need and find happiness.”"
"Omar’s initial tweet came three days after “Palestinian terrorists in Gaza launched more than 150 rockets at Israel” from November 10-13, 2012, reports the Jewish Virtual Library."
"On November 14, the Israeli Air Force killed Ahmad Jabari in an air strike."
"Jabari, the military commander of Hamas, was allegedly responsible for, or instrumental in, multiples terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and military personnel since the 1990s."
"On November 15, another terrorist-launched rocket killed three Israeli civilians."
This and other rocket launches from Palestinian militants in Gaza prompted Israel to initiate Operation Pillar of Defense.
"According to Israel’s official New York consulate website, during the operation, “the IDF targeted over 1,500 terror sites including 19 senior command centers, operational control centers and Hamas’ senior-rank headquarters, 30 senior operatives, damaging Hamas’ command and control, hundreds of underground rocket launchers, 140 smuggling tunnels, 66 terror tunnels, dozens of Hamas operation rooms and bases, 26 weapon manufacturing and storage facilities and dozens of long-range rocket launchers and launch sites.”"

"If the Democrats take over the Congress, Nancy Pelosi has already said that passing gun control is one of her top priorities."
The study reported that gun owners are more likely to show up to vote than those who support gun control.

"So to that end, Gun Owners of America has released the recent voting records of your congressman and senators."
Our New Muslim Representatives
Tlaib is a vociferous foe of Israel.
"The House is likely to do all it can to roll back President Trump’s pro-Israel polices, with Tlaib as well as Omar as becoming the public faces of the effort."
"She did say, however, that she favors a one-state, not two-state, “solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: “One state."
It has to be one state.
Separate but equal does not work.
I’m only 42 years old but my teachers were of that generation that marched with Martin Luther King.
Indeed it doesn’t.
A Palestinian state would be a new base for renewed jihad attacks against Israel.
"But a “one-state solution” would be even worse, unless that state is the current State of Israel, but that is not the one state Tlaib has in mind."
"She is calling for an Israeli/Palestinian state that would not be a Jewish State or a homeland for the Jewish people, but a federation in which Palestinians would soon overwhelm Jews demographically."
"Progressive denial of their rights would soon follow: as I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS, there has never been a majority Muslim nation in which Jews enjoyed equality of rights with Muslims."
Tlaib’s unitary state would be no different.
"Steinberg reports that Omar has “faced allegations -- soon backed by a remarkable amount of evidence -- that she had married her own brother in 2009, and was still legally his wife."
They officially divorced in December 2017.
The motivation for the marriage remains unclear.
"However, the totality of the evidence points to possible immigration fraud and student loan fraud.” What’s more, she swore to apparent falsehoods in court."
"But Leftists rarely have to answer for their corruption, and in a Democrat House, Omar will much more likely be celebrated than investigated."
"She and Tlaib will enjoy establishment media accolades as they pursue their hard-Left, anti-American, anti-Israel agenda."
Assange Never Met Manafort.
The problem with this latest fabrication is that Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.
This is impossible.
"The visitor logs were not kept by Wikileaks, but by the very strict Ecuadorean security."
Nobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs.
The procedure was very thorough.
"To go in, you had to submit your passport (no other type of document was accepted)."
A copy of your passport was taken and the passport details entered into the log.
"Your passport, along with your mobile phone and any other electronic equipment, was retained until you left, along with your bag and coat."
I feature in the logs every time I visited.
There were no exceptions.
What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?
I would love to believe that the fact Julian has never met Manafort is bound to be established.
I am not a fan of Donald Trump.

"At one point the caravan was anywhere between 7,000 to 10,000 members strong and mostly consists of migrants with ineligible asylum claims, which include job-seekers, previously deported illegal aliens, and Central Americans looking to get away from crime."
"None of these are eligible asylum claims, Breitbart reports."
"According to the New York Times, lawyers with the National Lawyers Guild, a Soros-backed organization, are aiding the caravan migrants before they attempt to seek asylum in the U.S.:"
"Others have begun to deal in practicalities, walking a mile from the shelter to enter their names on a waiting list for an asylum interview."

"Last week, Breitbart News reported how caravan migrants in Tijuana began scaling the U.S.-Mexico border fence."
"In response, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has placed razor wire along the fence."
"To deal with the perceived threat the US has deployed 5,200 troops to help more than 2,000 National Guardsmen thwart what President Trump describes as an impending migrant“invasion.”"
"Over the past few weeks, the active-duty servicemen deployed under Operation Faithful Patriot have mainly been erecting barbed-wire fences along the border in Texas, California and Arizona, as well as building shelter accommodation for customs and border protection staff."
Groups of Migrants Heading to San Diego Will Be Met With Barricades And Razor Fences (Videos)
The Military continues to put up razor wire at the border in San Ysidro as a migrant caravan is expected to reach Tijuana.
"United States military and border protection agents have been erecting barricades with razor wire at the point of entry near San Diego, California, as the first groups of migrants arrived at the US-Mexico border."
Hundreds of migrants who had split off from the main ‘caravan’ of thousands arrived in Tijuana early Tuesday on nine buses.
"Numbering just over 350, they joined an initial smaller group of around 85 people, mostly members of the LGBT community, who’d experienced discrimination within the main crowd and were helped to make it to the Mexican border town even earlier on Sunday."

"In anticipation of potential clashes at the border, American soldiers have begun reinforcing their positions."
"“Department of Defense personnel are installing concertina wire, and pre-positioning jersey barriers, barricades, and fencing,” US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement."

"To tackle any “potential safety and security risk,” the CBP also announced lane closures at the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa ports of entry, to install “port hardening infrastructure equipment” in preparation for the migrant caravan arrival."
"Currently, several thousand predominantly male Central American migrants heading for the US are in the western Mexico city of Guadalajara."
"Most of them intend to take the Pacific coast route to reach the US, which is still about 1,500 miles away."

They Are Coming: Migrant Caravan Resumes March to US Border (Video)
Thousands of migrants are making their way to the US border where they will be met with barbed wire and American forces blocking their illegal entry into the United States.

The migrant caravan has resumed their march through Mexico towards the U.S. border that is being reinforced by the Army and Marine Corps.
President Trump has effectively suspended the granting of asylum to migrants who cross illegally.
"Trump signed the order on Friday, and it went into effect on Saturday."
The order means that migrants will have to present themselves at U.S. ports of entry to qualify for asylum and follow other rules unveiled on Thursday that seek to limit asylum claims.
"After spending almost a week in Mexico City, where many refused to accept asylum from Mexico, the caravan, made up mostly of male Hondurans, but also nationals of other Central American countries, is now on the move towards the United States border."
"A Ruptly video shows hundreds of people getting on trains in Mexico subway, and boarding heavy trucks or buses somewhere outside the city."
Others are seen using cars to continue their trek towards the border.

"(Tallahassee) Project Veritas Action Fund has released undercover video from Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum’s campaign, revealing his election strategy includes making empty promises to voters."
This is the seventh undercover video report Project Veritas has released in a series revealing secrets and lies from political campaigns in 2018.
Gillum campaign makes promises it knows it can’t keep
SMITH: “That’s not for them to know… That’s not for them to know.
Give me another position.
"Medicare for all, that will never happen."
"The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican controlled."
"Democratic governor, Republican legislature."
"The poor, the middle income."
You have to whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote.
SMITH: “You have to appeal to white guilt… [be]cause that’s what it is.”
"So he was being left, not left of center… For the primary."
Now [in the general] he’s going back to left of center.”
"Dale Holeness, who is the Broward County Commissioner and also works on Gillum’s campaign, explains Gillum’s gun control views:"
"HOLENESS: “There ought to be at least a three-day waiting period for everybody and a full background check for everybody… And we need to- And these automatic guns with sixteen rounds a minute, they ought to not be on the streets either, so that’s his plan.”"
"Adrian Young, who works for the Florida Democratic Party also elaborates on Gillum’s gun control views in the report:"

Caught on video: Gillum staffer makes racist statements and admits campaign is lying to voters
"In the latest Project Veritas midterm election sting, staffers working for Florida Democratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum are caught on camera revealing Gillum’s campaign promises are lies and making racist statements about Florida voters."
"“Remember our saying, modern-day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected,'” Smith says."
"He points to specific campaign promises Gillum has made, including raising the corporate tax in Florida, raising teacher pay, and Medicare for All, admitting they are lies."
"So, let’s go back to Mr. Gillum’s platform, right?"
Raise the corporate tax in Florida from 7 to 11 percent.
That will never happen.
"Raise teachers’ pay to $50,000; that will never happen."
Give me another position.
Medicare for all; that will never happen.
"The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican-controlled."
"Democratic governor, Republican legislature."
"So, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass."
The full video shows Smith saying that the strategy to change the Florida legislature is to take “poor” and “middle income” people and “whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote.”
Smith defines Gillum’s political beliefs as “part of the crazy crazy crazies” on the progressive Left.
More damaging footage includes Democratic operatives explaining Gillum’s positions on gun control and indicating he would support banning AR-15 rifles.
Florida Democrat Party community engagement specialist Adrian Young also admits on video that Gillum is not campaigning with that position because it would be unpopular with Florida voters.
"“I do think he’s not saying specifically like I’m going to ban bump stocks or I’m against ARs, only because he’s running a race right now."
"“What we found in the Gillum campaign was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona, a candidate lying to the voters he needs to win the election,” said Project Veritas Action President James O’Keefe."
Watch the full video:
They won’t be doing any of that now.
"In fact, It’s got a whole new look now."
We won’t be seeing anything near the same bravado with people scaling up and over this one.

Here’s what the President said with the photo:
“The Fake News is showing old footage of people climbing over our Ocean Area Fence.
Here’s some footage of that razor wire going up.
"Here’s what the military was REALLY up to, when CNN and the rest had their little fever dreams about cross-border gun battles."
"If Congress insists on dragging its feet with the building and funding of a permanent solution, Trump will find other ways to secure our Southern border as he had promised to do."

"The Trumpinator: every time his rivals think they’ve got him down and out, he stands back up and keeps on coming."
They laughed when he announced his candidacy.
They thought he was just some kind of a circus sideshow act.
He survived the primaries and got the nomination.
"He beat CNN at their own game, and their ratings are now circling the toilet."
"Mueller and the Dossier aren’t just coming up empty, they’re exposing the misdeeds of Brennan, Comey, McCabe, Strzok and all the rest."
"And Trump is still keeping promises, and getting things done."
The economy is doing exactly what he promised it would.

Broward County Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes Resigns Amid Florida Voter Fraud

“It is true.
"She did send it,” said Burnadette Norris-Weeks, an attorney who works as counsel to the Supervisor of Elections Office."
"Evelyn Perez-Verdia, a former office spokeswoman who left several years ago, said Sunday evening she was told by people in the office that the letter was sent “to Tallahassee” earlier in the day."
Norris-Weeks said she saw an early draft of the letter.
"In the version she saw, she said Snipes, 75, expressed a desire to spend more time with her family."
"In the final version of the resignation letter, sent to Gov."
"“I am ready to pass the torch,” she wrote in the letter, which made no mention of controversies surrounding the 2018 election."
"“Although I have enjoyed this work tremendously over these many election cycles, both large and small, I am ready to pass the torch,” she wrote."
"Snipes allowed illegal aliens, non-citizens and felons to vote."
"According to Breitbart, she illegally destroyed ballots."
Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes’ office has admitted “they don’t know” how many ballots there are still to count.
"Snipes’ latest failure to finalize Tuesday’s election returns days after the polls closed is also in violation of Florida law, which requires elections officials to “report all early voting and all tabulated vote-by-mail results to the Department of State within 30 minutes after the polls close."
"Thereafter, the canvassing board shall report, with the exception of provisional ballot results, updated precinct election results to the department at least every 45 minutes until all results are completely reported.”"
"The irony that a constitutionally ineligible candidate for the presidency and RINO extraordinaire, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), pointed out that voter fraud going on in Florida just a day after the elections probably didn't help the pressure that Snipes was facing."
Dems got voters to use altered forms to fix & submit as many mail ballots as possible after FL deadline in hopes that a judge would later order state to count them.
Today that’s exactly what a federal judge did.
"https://t.co/MC4Tlvy9gi — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 15, 2018"
Naples Daily News:
"A day after Florida’s election left top state races too close to call, a Democratic party leader directed staffers and volunteers to share altered election forms with voters to fix signature problems on absentee ballots after the state’s deadline."
"The altered forms surfaced in Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties and were reported to federal prosecutors to review for possible election fraud as Florida counties completed a required recount in three top races."
But an email obtained by the USA TODAY NETWORK – Florida shows that Florida Democrats were organizing a broader statewide effort beyond those counties to give voters the altered forms to fix improper absentee ballots after the Nov. 5 deadline.
"Democratic party leaders provided staffers with copies of a form, known as a “cure affidavit,” that had been modified to include an inaccurate Nov. 8 deadline."
"We also know that a Broward County employee, Chelsey Smith, signed an affidavit affirming that she had seen members of Snipes' staff engaging in voter fraud."

The migrants previously made a days-long stop in Mexico City.
"The caravan, made up mostly of Hondurans, but also nationals of other Central American countries, is now on the move towards the United States border."
Migrants resumed their march north on Saturday morning after spending almost a week in Mexico City.

"Last week, the Florida Department of State asked federal prosecutors to look into alterations made on official election documents from the 2018 midterms."
Politico reported that the department points to the Florida Democratic Party for changing dates on forms used to amend absentee and mail-in ballots.
These ballots would have been flagged for missing information or for being filled out with incorrect information.
"The amending forms, called “cure affidavits,” were due at 5 p.m on Nov. 5, the evening before Election Day, at the latest."
"During pre-Election Day absentee and mail-in voting, political parties have access to lists of people whose mail-in ballots were rejected for errors."
"Meanwhile, cure affidavits are publicly available and anyone can send them to voters to prompt them to “fix” their ballots."
"According to Politico, the DOS released affidavits on Tuesday, which demonstrate that four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m on Thursday, Nov. 8, past the official due date."
"Among the counties involved with the altered affidavits is Broward, which has been a hotspot for controversy as many Florida races have led to a recount."

Politico reported that they received audio of a Florida Democratic party volunteer leaving a voicemail to a voter in Palm Beach County to revise their mailed ballot after Election Day.
Palm Beach County failed to make Florida’s recount deadline on Thursday.
"Matt Dixon, bureau chief of Politico, tweeted on Wednesday that the Democratic party volunteer call came during Florida’s ballot recount after ballots were allowed to be amended."
"“We are now doing a recount, so we want to make sure you let your vote be counted,” Dixon quoted from the voicemail."
It seems that Democrats may have called absentee voters about supplying them with cure affidavits after the permitted date.
"It also looks like whoever sent out the cure affidavits physically changed the due date to say Nov. 8, instead of Nov. 6."
"According to DOS officials, they are less concerned with the inaccurate dates, and more concerned with the fact that the cure affidavits appear to have been deliberately altered."
State officials turned over the altered forms to federal investigators.
"Of the many allegations of ballot mishandling in Florida, this is the first that has been referred to the federal government."
While Democrats seem to have told voters they could fix ballot errors up to the Thursday after Election Day — these votes could not count.

"“Top FL County Election Official Illegally Let People Vote Over Fax, Email,” by Randy DeSoto, Western Journal, November 13, 2018 (thanks to Mark):"
"The top election official in heavily Republican Bay County allowed residents displaced by Hurricane Michael to vote by email and fax, contrary to Florida law."
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and others are expressing outrage at the special provision made for these voters.
"The Miami Herald reported that Bay County Supervisor of Elections Mark Andersen said on Monday that 11 ballots were accepted by email and 147 were faxed in, though Florida law only permits those serving in the military overseas to use these methods…."
"According to the Herald, Gov."
"Rick Scott issued an executive order on Oct. 18 allowing election supervisors in Bay County and other counties impacted by the storm to extend early voting days and designate more early voting locations, but did not make provision for voting by fax or email."
"“These are the stories that we know,” Gillum said."
"“Imagine the ones that we don’t.” Meanwhile, Gillum along with Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson continue to call for all the votes to be counted in heavily Democratic Broward and Palm Beach counties, despite election officials in both missing state mandated deadlines in providing vote tallies."

"The concerns, which the department says can be tied to the Florida Democratic Party, center around date changes on forms used to fix vote-by-mail ballots sent with incorrect or missing information."
"Known as “cure affidavits,” those documents used to fix mail ballots were due no later than 5 p.m. on Nov. 5 — the day before the election."
"But affidavits released on Tuesday by the DOS show that documents from four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m. on Thursday, which is not accurate."
"Audio of a Florida Democratic Party caller leaving a voicemail message asking a Palm Beach County voter to fix their vote by mail ballot after Election Day, which is not allowed, was also sent to POLITICO separately."
It was not part of the information turned over to federal prosecutors.
"Among the counties in question is Broward, which emerged as the epicenter of controversy as three statewide races and three local legislative races went into recounts following the Nov. 6 elections."
DOS officials have repeatedly told the media that the monitors they sent to Broward County saw no election fraud.
It wasn’t until Tuesday that the office revealed publicly that it had turned over information to federal prosecutors.
The letter was sent to U.S.
"Attorneys Christopher P. Canova of the Northern District of Florida, Maria Chapa Lopez of the Middle District of Florida and Ariana Fajardo Orshan in the Southern District of Florida."
"The records released by DOS, which is part of Gov."
Political parties can get daily lists of people who had their mail-in ballots rejected.
Political parties — or anyone else — can also get the publicly available cure affidavits and send them to voters who had a mail-in ballot rejected to encourage them to fix the ballots.
"In an email chain released as part of the Department of State’s Tuesday document dump, Citrus County Supervisor of Elections Susan Gill last week told DOS officials that a voter who received one of the cure affidavits with the wrong date had also received a call from a number identified as the Tallahassee office of the Florida Democratic Party, an indication the party was reaching out about her vote by mail ballot."
"“When I called it, it is the Democratic Party of Florida,” she said in a Nov. 8 email to DOS officials."
She went on to write that she thinks the incorrect date was used because whoever sent the cure affidavit mixed up the deadline for cure affidavits with the deadline for provisional ballots.
Members from one of the migrant caravans finally reached the US border on Tuesday.
Fox 5 reports:
SAN DIEGO -- People on the Mexican side of the border could be seen climbing the fence near Border Field State Park Tuesday afternoon after part of the Central American migrant caravan arrived in Tijuana.

Several people scaled the fence and sat on top of it.
A few jumped or crawled to openings in the fence onto U.S. soil but quickly ran back as Border Patrol agents approached.
"Several border agents were seen patrolling the area in trucks, 4-wheelers, a helicopter and on horses."
Video of the migrants was captured in various reports.

"So far, we are being told that authorities are keeping an eye on the migrants as they celebrate their journey, but no reports have been issued saying they have actually crossed over yet."
"It is intended to provide evidence for long-standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump, and Trump’s supposed backers in the Kremlin, to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race."
"These show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton’s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, lost."
"Manafort has denied the Guardian’s claims, while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel."
‘Responsible for Trump’
The emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule.
"The intention is to deeply discredit Assange, and by extension the Wikileaks organisation, in the eyes of right-thinking liberals."
"That, in turn, will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents: the use of new media to hold to account the old, corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency."
"The Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador’s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media."
It will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US.
And it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time.
See here and here.
Now Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again.
An administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange.
Heavy surveillance
"Glenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world, with CCTV cameras everywhere."
"The environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily, with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange’s fate."
Former British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit.
Any visits by Manafort would have been logged.
Murray:
That at the very least hints that the Guardian thought they had “insurance” on this story.
"And the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services – presumably of Britain, the United States and / or Ecuador."
"A pattern, not an aberration"
I think the Guardian is an important paper with great journalists.
I hope the story turns out true.
"If Manafort went there, there's video."
Let's see it.

Deeper malaise
What this misses is that the Guardian’s attacks on Assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity.
They are entirely predictable and systematic.
"See here, here and here."

"November 29, 2018"
In 2015 the British Guardian appointed Katherine Viner as editor in chief.
Under her lead the paper took a new direction.
"On November 27 the Guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that Paula Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange, the publisher of Wikileaks, in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on at least three occasions."
Some two hours before the story went public it contacted Manafort and Assange's lawyers to get their comments.
Assange's Wikileaks responded through its public Twitter account which has 5.4 million followers.
On of those followers is Katherine Viner:
It attached the email the Guardian's Luke Harding had send.
90 minutes later the Guardian piece went life.
It led the front page and also appeared in print.
The first version read:
"Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump’s campaign, the Guardian has been told."
"Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 – during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump’s push for the White House."
It is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.
"But the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia."
A well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016.
Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers.
His lawyers declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.
The piece did not include the public denial Wikileaks issued to its 5.4 million followers one and a half hour before it was published.
The Guardian piece came at a critical moment.
Currently the U.K. and Ecuador conspire to deliver Julian Assange to U.S. authorities.
"On Monday special counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort lied to investigators, violating his recent plea deal."
They distributed is as a factual account.
It is likely that millions of people took note of its claim.
Glenn Greenwald noted that the Ecuadorian embassy is under heavy CCTV surveillance.
"There are several guards, and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it."
Every visit is logged.
"If Manafort had really visited Assange, it would have long been known:"
A year ago an important Moon of Alabama piece - From Snowden To Russia-gate - The CIA And The Media - mentioned Harding:
Shortly after the Guardian's fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial:
"“I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,” the statement said."
"“I have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly."
We are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false.”
At 16:05 utc the Guardian silently edited the story.
Caveats (here in italic and underlined) were added to the headline and within several paragraphs.
No editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes:
"Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy, sources say ..."
It is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.
"But the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia."
...
Why Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear.
...
His lawyers initially declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the visits.
One paragraph was added to included Wikileaks' denial:
In a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met.
"At 16:30 utc, under fire from other media and journalists, the Guardian issued a statement:"
This story relied on a number of sources.
We put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange's representatives prior to publication.
Neither responded to deny the visits taking place.
We have since updated the story to reflect their denials.
At 21:05 utc a third version was published which included Manafort's denial.
Half an hour later Julian Assange instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel.
Wikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit.
As Disobediant Media notes (emphasis in the original):
"Jonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer, makes a similar point:"
Within hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news.
...
Harding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia’s intelligence operation against the West’s democratic institutions.
...
"If this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false—that is, if, for example, the sources lied to Harding and Collyns (or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists), or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake, the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad."
It also included the false claim that Glenn Greenwald worked with Wikileaks on the Snowden papers.
That claim was later removed.
We have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair.
"When 'western' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake."

"SNL Indian Comedian Silenced for ""Offensive Jokes"" at Columbia"
Andy Warhol was only half-right.
"Patel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing."
Patel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock.
"During the event, Patel’s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City—including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood—which AAA officials deemed inappropriate."
"I can't imagine what they would have made of Richard Pryor, or at this point even, Chris Rock."
It's also a version of a Sammy Davis Jr joke about converting to Judaism.
Which is now a hate crime.
"Patel pushed back on the officials’ remarks, and said that while he stood in solidarity with Asian American identities, none of his remarks were offensive, and he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found “in the real world.” Before he could finish, Patel’s microphone was cut from off-stage, and he proceeded to leave."
The real world?
This is Columbia.
"For Sofia Jao, BC ‘22, problems with the performance resided not in the set, but with Patel’s closing remarks."
“I really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world.
"Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it’s not and continuing to perpetuate the un-safeness of it… is saying that it can’t be changed,” said Jao."
